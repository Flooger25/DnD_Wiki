## History

### Formation

During the events of the [great cataclysm](../../Events/great_cataclysm.md), Athal was an anarchy state not yet absorbed into the Caelian Union. In 9 5A, the collective powers of Northern and Central Meridia claimed the Athal region of their own, which resulted in conflicts in the channel between the regions. Since Athal was not a formed state, they fell to the Meridian powers within months. For the following 63 years, Athal was ruled brutally by the Meridians, until the political influence of Eastern Meridia's [Six](../../Characters/13/six.md) and his [Mors Marauders](../../Factions/Organizations/mors_marauders.md). In 72 5A, Athal was given independence, and the Kingdom of Athal was formed.
