# Caelian Union

After the fall of the Caelian Empire, the eastern regions banded together to form the [Caelian Union](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_union.md). They existed as a puppet state during the first few decades of the 5th Age, until they were granted complete independence by Eastern Meridia in 51 5A.
