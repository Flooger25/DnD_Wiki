# Caelian Empire

The Caelian Empire, commonly referred to as just "the Empire" at the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th age, and later known as the Ancient Empire, was a dictatorial human-run regime bent on cleansing the world of undesirables and forming a world of only humans. To achieve this goal, the Empire indulged in horrific acts such as enslavement, genocide, and war with neighboring countries. The Empire became the first example of totalitarian extremes, to which many later dark kingdoms draw their influences.

The Empire was founded and ruled by [High Lord Oric Valdes](../../Characters/oric_valdes), while under the spiritual influence of [Arch Witch Kisiri](../../Characters/kisiri.md), until his inevitable assassination by the hands of the legendary adventure group known as [13](../../Characters/13/13.md). After the High Lord's death, the Empire began to crumble until its dissolution in 1344 PA.

For the following few centuries after its fall, long living loyalists to the regime continued to influence other nations' politics in the [South Eastern Corner](../../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md#south-eastern-corner).

Below is a visual of the Empire's growth in power during it's invasion of Meridia, known as the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md).

## Description

## Geography

## Government

The Caelian Empire was ruled by the High Lord and them alone. During the time of the empire's inception, there were a very select group of nobles who worked as advisors to Duke Oric Valdes as the transition from the Dominion had caused chaos and instability on Caelus. There were several governors of regions on Caelus that submitted to the Duke's claim, which later on fulfilled pivotal roles for managing the states the empire would eventually conquer.

The government of the empire followed an ordered hierarchy where every individual was responsible for one particular role, who was under the commander of every given unit. The structure is as follows:

| Rank |  Role | Direct Reports | # of Reports |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | High Lord of the Caelian Empire | Marshalls<br>Caelian Consuls | 10<br>7 |
| 2 | Marshall of `<geographic region>` | Governors | 5-40 |
| 3 | Caelian Consul | *sometimes* Captains | 3 |
| 4 | Governor of `<geographic sub-region>` | Imperial Legates<br>Count/Countess | 10-15 |
| 5 | Imperial Legate | Captains | 10-35 |
| 6 | Captain | - | 80-250 |
| 7 | Count/Countess | Baron/Baroness | 3-30 |
| 8 | Baron/Baroness | - | - |

Some notable marshalls include:

- Aylmar Sylren
  - Known as the "Satan of the Sea", Aylmar managed the military and governing district of the South Eastern Sea, including the Commodian Isles
- Isaac Serir
- Li Amory
