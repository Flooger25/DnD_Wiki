# Dragon

Dragons (or wyrms) are a very powerful, ancient, and magical race of creatures. There were several types of the most common of which were chromatic and metallic, which were typically evil and good respectively. The line of dragons are so old, they had their own realm during the first recorded exploits of the elves. In recent times, the dragons of Pulchra were nearly all recluses or at the very least deceptive to their true nature, living amongst other species in polymorphed form.
