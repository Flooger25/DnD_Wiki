# Katarus

Katarus was the 38th Archmage of Meridia and ally of the legendary adventure group [13](13/13.md). He helped the group contact [Miirakail](miirakail.md) to learn of how to defeat [High Lord Valdes](oric_valdes.md) during the [Meridian Wars](../Events/meridian_wars.md). Katarus was an Archmage of Meridia, therefore he contained great power as a wizard, being able to command 9th level spells. Despite how powerful he was, however, he was eventually slain in [Inelethor](../Locations/Towns/inelethor.md) when fighting against the newly reborn [Kisiri](kisiri.md), but his legacy as an archmage lives on through his apprentice Phaelah.
