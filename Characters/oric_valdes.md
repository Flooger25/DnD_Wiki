# Oric Valdes

Oric Valdes was the 8th Duke of Ebrihan, second wielder of [Fraemia](../Objects/fraemia.md), Imperator, and eventually the High Lord of the [Caelian Empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md). He acted as one of the primary antagonists of the [Caelian Trilogy](../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md). Oric was born to war and blessed with divine strength. He was a powerful opponent, and ally, for he was cunning, ruthless, and a political mastermind. Besides his intellect, his physical strength was unrivaled between mortals.

"I know what it's like to win and then to lose everything. After we pushed those swine of Orcs, Dwarves, and all others back from Ebrihan, the Necromancer had quite the final strike indeed. My home suffered a war its leaders, whose responsibility was to protect them, had started. Soon the King's empire will die like my homeland. The Rise of Ebrihan is nigh, and you cannot stop it."

## Description

Oric was an extremely intelligent, ruthless, and charismatic leader who stood over 6 feet tall. His body was muscular and built like a true warrior, and despite this, his intelligence was matched in physical strength. Oric had the capability to deceive those around him with his appearance, often in his later years intentionally presenting himself as a fragile and kind old man. His convictions were stronger than steel, often they became reality for he was unstoppable politically. Known to have little concern for those around him, he used his charismatic prowess to obtain what he wanted, and if that were not good enough, rarely so, his physical power would get the job done. He strives to avenge those who he held dear to his heart, such as the Ebrihanians and his former group the Silver Guardians.

## History

### Early life

Oric was born in 1273 PA in Kisiria and grew up near the villages of Swindon and Maelony. There is no recorded history of who his parents were, other than the fact that his birth name was Odeil Varsc.

When the [War of the Fields](../Events/war_of_the_fields.md) broke out in 1280 PA, chaos enveloped the lands and led to the destruction of Oric's regional home. Starting at the age of 7, Oric was homeless and struggled to survive amongst the ruins and battles occurring in the region. It wasn't until 1281 PA that Oric was discovered by a child being cared for by a priestess in the forests of the region. Somehow, Oric had been surviving in the forests for the last year alone. The other children in the priestess's care didn't take notice to the new child, except for one who had apparently been playing with Oric, but the priestess herself felt something peculiar that had to be amended. During this time, the children and the priestess were encountered by [13](13/13.md), who were looking for Oric as well, and a consensus was found to look for the child in the forests nearby.

That night, while 13 was camped out, [Naddin](13/naddin.md) woke up in the middle of the forest, not near the rest of his party. He witnesses the 8 year old Oric walking alone amongst the trees, so Naddin follows. Oric walks up to a shrine covered in moss, and a hooded figure follows up right behind him to bend over and grab the boys hands, whispering to him, "I grant you the power of the white, and that of the true heir. Your artifact is waiting for you. The world is now tied to your fate, Oric Valdes." In this moment, a wave of divine energy envelops the young Oric, for he has been cursed with a piece of [Kisiri](kisiri.md)'s soul that would live off of his own, waiting to grow and be released.

### The Imperator

Oric's whereabouts are unknown for the following few years, but as the war rages on, a mysterious Necromancer reveals their self and dominates the forces of both the Eastern Alliance and the Dominion.

In 1288, a battle takes place where the Eastern Alliance's major forces are pinned in the city of Italiath by the hordes of the Necromancer's undead. Here is when Oric makes his first appearance as the Man in Gold, but later known as the Imperator. He wields the god weapon Fraemia in addition to a layer of golden armor that covers his entire body, and is able to single-handedly incinerate the hordes of undead with Fraemia's mass ejections of yellow lightning. The Necromancer's forces are nearly all destroyed.

"I am near the city, hiding from the screams. Our men have infiltrated the fortress, but once the horrors began, I knew something wrong had occurred. All I could see was the yellow lightning piercing the walls and sky. The witch did not prepare us for this. The undead have met their match, and this war had become the hells we dare not think of."

-- Unknown Dominion Soldier, 1288, Siege of Italiath

### Silver Guardians

In 1289, Oric is summoned by the Necromancer who asks for Oric to do a great task, and if that task is completed, the war will end. Oric thinks on his people, and queries what the task is. The Necromancer tells him that he must slay an ancient dragon of the name [Miirakail](miirakail.md). In this moment, Oric is greeted by other warriors with powers similar, albeit less impressive, than his own. Oric accepts the task, and through this, the Silver Guardians are born. For the next 6 months, the group traverses various realms, including [Limbo](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md), looking and hunting for this dragon. Their journey concludes with them finding Miirakail in a pocket dimension, and initiating combat with him. Both party's are severely injured from this encounter, but Miirakail prevails, only to tell the Guardians of the [Arch-Witch](kisiri.md) and how they're being played like puppets. The Guardians retreat and think on their actions. During this journey, the war continues and the front lines are pushed back into Ebrihan territory, so the group abandon the Necromancer and re-enter the war.

For the following year, under his Imperator name, Oric leads the Ebrihanian forces to push back the Dominion's, and he leads a betrayal against the Eastern Alliance of Orcs and Dwarves. By 1290 Oric gains the nickname "The Imperator of the Fields" and is promoted to commander of Ebrihan's forces, all at the age of 17.

In 1291, the Silver Guardians ambush a lost [13](13/13.md), only for them to be slayed. Their journey started off heroic, but like their lives, their fate was nothing but a lie.

Oric discovers the death of his party members, and assumes it was the Necromancer, so he sacrifices the war to hunt her down. When he encounters her, it is discovered she is a malformed shard of [Kisiri](kisiri.md)'s soul, and that she had summoned Oric's dead guardian allies as puppets in the final confrontation. A magnificent duel occurs between the Imperator of the Fields and the Necromancer and her undead Silver Guardians. Oric is victorious, and destroys the Necromancer.

The war ends with a victory from the Dominion, and absolute destruction on the eastern half of Caelus. Oric resigns his role as the Imperator, but keeps Fraemia close. He plots to punish the imperialist and corrupt crown of the Dominion, King [Aluuard Vidroth II](aluuard_vidroth.md).

### Duke of Ebrihan

For the following 21 years, Oric grows his political career, with his public history indicating only that he was a survivor of the war and that his parents had perished in conflict. He secretly dabbles in the underground world, only to lead to the creation of the [Ravens](../Factions/Organizations/ravens.md). His convictions of punishing the crown are appealing to the group, therefore his group of followers expands greatly over the next decade.

In 1312, Oric is crowned Duke of Ebrihan, after many years of working for and with the nobles of the region. He promises a bright future for Ebrihan by claiming that he will build the region into a regional superpower that cannot go unnoticed by others.

Scarred, but impressed, by the natural existence of the great dragon [Miirakail](miirakail.md), Oric desires to recreate that power by biologically and magically forming his own predator. In 1318 he secretly forms a laboratory under the ruins of Kisirith, and secretly funded with the aid of the Raven's and Ebrihan's treasury. The following year, the vile creature [Reigith the Deformed](reigith.md) was born into creation.

For the following 7 years, Oric plots to usurp the king and take over the Dominion, thus fulfilling the punishment deserved for invading and destroying the Dominion's own people, those in Ebrihan. He takes advantage of his anonymous political tie with the Ravens to slowly indoctrinate and take over the very skilled black knights of Ebrihan. They soon act as eyes and ears on the ground for the Ravens, and Duke Oric.

In the March of 1326, Oric enables Reigith and the first eastern towns are destroyed for the predator to practice dominating. The public is made unaware of the issue, only for it to be rumor. A month after, Princess Eilis Vidroth, heir to the Dominion, goes missing. Oric now has no heir to take over once the King is dead, until of course the newly formed [13](13/13.md) is able to find the laboratory and rescue Eilis. In response, Oric has a group of assassins attempt to take out the group, only for it to fail.

Things get more worrisome for Oric when the retired knight, Airgar, returns from hiding, thus posing a risk for him to lose control of the black knights of the land. Oric is now on his heels, and must act quickly. He responds by hiring 13 to seek out this rumored beast and slay it, thinking Reigith will destroy them. Knowing how quickly things are falling apart, Oric triggers the execution of his plan. After barely slaying Reigith, 13 return to Italiath only to be directed to the Eagle's Nest [](TODO). On their way, they are introduced to the Rise of Ebrihan as the capital of the Dominion, Andurin, is sieged and people are executed. Once arrived to the nest, the group are ambushed by a visage of the Imperator. By the time 13 complete their encounter, the transfer of power is already complete.

### High Lord Valdes

During this, Oric reorganizes the Dominion into the [Caelian Empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md) and names himself as the High Lord of the Caelian Empire. For the next 4 years, he orders that all non-humans and non-loyalists in the Empire be executed or enslaved. Nearly a million citizens are killed during this time. Oric also covertly hides Fraemia away in the depths of Italiath, only for Monte Pichon to later steal it for his collection. By this time, Oric's hatred has consumed him completely, and the effects of Kisiri's soul being with his own begin to take form. Oric's greed for power and hatred for all life brings his gaze upon the jewel nearby, Meridia.

In 1332, Oric begins his assault on the nearby Island Nations, including the [Commodian Isles](../Locations/Land/commodian_isles), thus beginning the [Meridian Wars](../Events/meridian_wars). By 1337 the entire South Eastern Corner had been pulled into the conflict, and the following year every nation had fallen to the Empire except for Western Meridia. During the conflict, Oric used the riches seized by Meridians and began construction on his palace and super-fortress known as the White Palace [](TODO) on top of the ruins of the Eagle's Nest. After the fall of Northern Meridia, the Empire's forces had discovered an Ancient White Dragon living in the mountains, so at the cost of nearly a thousand troops' lives, he had the dragon imprisoned and brought into the Lucent Burrows below the White Palace to serve as a guard for the secretive entrance.

In 1343, Oric is made aware of the return of [13](13/13.md) when one of the Empire's warships is sunk with the one survivor telling the tale of what had occurred. Out of anger, Oric orders the absolute destruction of Dorren [](TODO) and Pelrock Isle [](TODO). By this point in time, Oric's mind is lost to his trapped soul beyond the world. He feels like a puppet under the control of a malignant force, the force of Kisiri's soul. A few weeks later, Oric discovers that 13 had been in [Fallcrest City](../Locations/Towns/fallcrest_city.md), so he ordered that everyone be interrogated to find out where 13 is located. No useful information had been discovered, so the city was subsequently razed to the ground.

After traveling back in time, the death of Miirakail, stealing Fraemia, and slaying the beast in the burrows below, 13 is able to gain entrance to the White Palace and confront Oric directly, after 17 years of knowing only defeat. Oric is encountered by 13, and a great fight is fought. It concludes with Fraemia betraying Oric for [Burk Kvak](13/burk.md) and him being cut down by [Naddin](13/naddin.md). In the moment of his death, he embraces the release of Kisiri's soul from his own, despite the fact that she now has enough soul to be reborn once again.

### Redemption

After fleeting through the astral sea for a few days, Oric is guided to where his soul is to rest, in the secluded prison of one of Kisiri's fortresses in Limbo. Oric's form is of himself before he became the High Lord, and before Kisiri's soul began to puppet him. With enough soul free, the true form of Kisiri enters Oric's prison and taunts him, indicating that it is only the beginning for her and her rise.

"A primordial is to be awoken beyond the Infernal Rise, and then, then you may watch everything burn. Pulchra will be...reformed."

-- Kisiri

Oric lay there, waiting for eternity, knowing that he is only a toy for Kisiri's entertainment, until several months go by, and a very peculiar Dragonborn cleric arrives into his cosmic pocket dimension prison. Oric is reintroduced, for the third time, to the infamous [13](13/13.md) in Limbo. Here it is decided that 13 needs Oric to escape Limbo, and that they both need each other to destroy the Arch-Witch. Oric is also offered Fraemia as a test of his loyalty, but Oric declines this, citing that [Burk Kvak](13/burk.md) is now the new wielder for he is chosen.

Oric helps 13 and himself escape the prison, the [ruined city](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md#ruined-city), and Limbo. Oric is considered a temporary member of the team, despite their long rivalry with one another. In addition, many of Oric's powers have been retained, perhaps a part of his curse from Kisiri or something with Fraemia.

Once escaped from Limbo, Oric and 13 travel to the floating ruins Kisirith to finally confront Kisiri. A great fight against death knights occurs, and soon Kisiri enters the battle. Oric's life is concluded when he sacrifices his right arm, and his life, to land a devastating blow to Kisiri with Fraemia. This is just enough to help 13, and specifically Naddin, destroy Kisiri and for Oric to complete his arc of redemption.

Oric went down in history based on which role of his they perceived. To Ebrihan, he was a legend, to the Gods, another heretical user of the god weapon Fraemia, and to all others the devil incarnate. But to 13, he was a worthy rival.

## Powers

Oric Valdes' powers were unique but incredibly powerful for a mortal man. It is commonly assumed he was blessed with his powers when he was cursed by Kisiri in the woods of Swindon, however, it is clear that this was merely a method for Kisiri to latch part of her soul onto his. In addition, he seemed to retain powers even after using Fraemia, therefore his powers may come from merely birth or Fraemia itself.

Origins aside, Oric Valdes possessed incredible strength and martial prowess, being able to wield nearly any weapon, or even none, to defeat an opponent. It is very likely he learned his physical combat abilities during his time as the Imperator.

Besides his physical strength, Oric had the ability to control and redirect lightning, showing on multiple occasions the ability to even amplify and create lightning from his finger tips. The lighting ejected was not something to downplay either, for it could cause catastrophic damage for anyone not resistant to that damage.

The combination of his magical and physical abilities allowed him to take on a level 9 [13](13/13.md) in the White Palace without being armed. In addition, when released from his imprisonment by the same party in Limbo, he was able to take out 3 death knights (CR 17) and various yugoloths (CR 9-12) in only a couple of rounds. During his time as Imperator as well, he was able to defend against, and eventually defeat, the undead form of the Silver Guardians and the Necromancer, however, he also wielded [Fraemia](../Objects/fraemia.md).

Without weapons, Oric is suggested to be a CR 23+, but given his performance in Kisiri's fortress in Limbo, it is likely several values higher. All things considered, Oric Valdes is one of the most powerful mortals the world has ever seen without the blood of the gods for very few, if not none, can compare to his strength.
