# Kisiri

Arch Witch Kisiri, also known as the Queen, the Daughter, and simply Kisiri, was an extremely powerful, mortal-born archlich who achieved the highest tier of power one could without formally ascending to godhood, and was one of the primary antagonists of the [Caelian Trilogy](../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md). As the daughter of [Anduin the Great](anduin_the_great.md), she was born with extraordinary power as a sorcerer and at an early age was able to surpass those who had studied and practiced in the arcane arts their whole lives. At one point, Kisiri was touched by "the darkness" and decided the world was for her taking. She slayed her father, destroyed his kingdom, and eventually dueled with her younger brother [Andurin](andurin.md) to the death.

She secretly had split her soul to achieve lichdom, however, and after her "death" moved between the planes as a ghastly figure for the following millennia. After the death of [High Lord Valdes](oric_valdes.md) by the hands of [13](13/13.md), enough of her soul was released to lead to her reassuming physical form from the blood of her descendant, Queen Eilis. With her return, she attempted to continue her mission to take the world as her own, only for her to be stopped by the unlikely hands of [13](13/13.md).

For the rest of history she became known as the Arch Witch, for there had yet to be any mortal human who has assumed so much arcane power before her. Some reluctantly consider her the most powerful arcanist of the [4th age](../Events/timeline.md#4th---age-of-the-ancients), others consider her the most powerful wizard *and* sorcerer of all time.

"He is with her, and she is with him. He is with her, and she is with him. The legend is nigh, reborn from ashes. The Queen bequeaths the soul of the bound. Are you here to claim the one? Thou who hast risen before, shall rise once again, but are you present to claim the bounded?"

## History

### Early Life

Kisiri was born sometime after her father, [Anduin](anduin_the_great.md)'s, arrival and colonization of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md), and was the first born and older sister to [Andurin](andurin.md). By the very early age of 3, Kisiri had showed an immense connection with the arcane arts by being able to levitate entire houses without even realizing. This puzzled arcanists at the time, for they had never seen anyone like her and desired to experiment on the young child, but Anduin had ordered she be trained to understand and control her gifts.

For the next 5 years of her youth, she was trained and educated on how to manager her powers by the sorcerers of the [Dominion](../Factions/Nations/dominion_of_anduin.md). She felt her growth was being stunted, for even the high level magic was not enough to push her to her limits, so she began reading wizard books without permission. After witnessing her casting non-sorcerer magic, the arcanists of the kingdom realized her true potential.

Kisiri continued to grow and learn past her adolescence, showing great intelligence, charisma, and leadership capabilities. Everything about her character seemed perfect, except for her relationship with her parents. Her father always preferred her younger brother, Andurin, over every achievement she had made. This drove her to push herself harder and harder to impress him and to receive his approval. Through this effort, she was not taken seriously by her father, and the relationship faded to being father and daughter to just acquaintances after her mother's death.

During her early adulthood, she became the master arcanist in the Dominion, the highest honor bestowed upon someone with magical abilities. This was not good enough for Anduin, so she felt her life was to end there, atop the world of magical academia. This idea was solidified when Anduin chose Andurin as the successor to the throne, for Kisiri had expected to fill that role, but it was now taken. Despite her superior mental and magical power, Anduin cared not to listen to what her potential as a leader would be. She showed care in her subordinates and advocated for the best of everyone, but this was not what Anduin wanted in his succession.

Soon, Kisiri left the city, and disappeared in the wilderness out of anger, frustration, and sadness. Her departure had lasted for days, then weeks, and eventually months. No one in the kingdom knew of her whereabouts.

### Fall into darkness

During the initial weeks of her self inflicted exodus, something peculiar had been experienced. She arrived to a pond somewhere in the northern half of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md), a pond of black water that seems to live and breathe. A calm voice spoke to her from the darkness, "Would you like to taste oblivion? To see the truth of it all? Would you like to live beyond infinity?" and in this moment, the "darkness" had touched her, and she was forever changed.

Ideas can be a dangerous thing, for they are like a parasite that cannot be cleansed. For Kisiri, the idea was simple yet justified. The world is to exist as she sees fit, for the world is her product, child, and creation. To build the world through her eye, she must destroy the old, and this is where it all began.

For the next 5 years, Kisiri planned and conjured her final goal. During this time, she used her knowledge to split her soul into various objects and creatures including:

- Miirakail himself during her duel with him. Kisiri was able to steal his left eye of clairvoyance, but just barely survive and seal part of her soul in him unknowingly. For he is a creature expected to live thousands of more years, he is the perfect living candidate.
- An obelisk that is to be hidden in a realm far from the material plane, Limbo.
- Forests of Kisiria

Once enough of her soul was protected, she began her assault on the Dominion. She single handedly slayed all who stood in her path as she conquered the city of [Andurin](../Locations/Towns/andurin.md), including her father. Afterwards, she torched the city to the ground, including killing the citizens she swore to protect. Nothing was to left to stop her, except her brother, Andurin, who at this point was not in the Dominion.

The new world was to begin in the heart of Kisiria, the only gift to Kisiri from Anduin being the name of the land and capital. She began to turn it into a floating city to ascend beyond the heavens, until the first wielder of the [god weapon](../Objects/fraemia.md) arrived, Andurin. A magnificent but deadly duel occurred between brother and sister, son and daughter, which claimed the lives of both Andurin and Kisiri. With Andurin's last breath, he assumed Kisiri was gone, but felt a dark magic, so he sealed a memory of himself into the god weapon, [Fraemia](../Objects/fraemia.md), in the hopes of warning of her potential return in the future.
