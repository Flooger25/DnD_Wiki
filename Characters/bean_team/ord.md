## After Bean Team

After the final battle, Ord felt a deep sense of pride in what the Bean Team had accomplished. They had vanquished the enemies of Dan, destroyed evil, and saved the world. Yet, when Ord looked at himself, he saw the toll that years of fighting had taken—his once gleaming armor now cracked, his trusty trident dulled, and his leathery skin worn from battle. Though he missed his fallen comrades, he didn’t feel guilt for surviving, but rather a lingering sense of survivor’s guilt, perhaps because fighting had been his life for so long. Now, surrounded by the family he had chosen for himself, Ord stood amidst the greatest victory he could have hoped to achieve.

Despite the triumph, the years of conflict had weighed heavily on him. The loss of friends, ships, and allies had taken its toll, and he worried about the safety of his surviving comrades. However, he took pride in having built the Bean Team, a group that had grown into a close-knit family. Ord had a unique talent for bringing people together, even former enemies, and inspiring them to join a noble cause. Now, just months after their final campaign, he faced his next big decision.

Ord honored his promise to Gilligan, bidding him a difficult farewell as Gilligan left for wizard school. He left behind his trident as a gift for Gilligan to open upon graduation. Then, Ord informed the Bean Team and its unofficial members, like Commodore Ford, of his plans and returned to Dalry, the town where the Bean Team was formed. There, he took over the church of Dan, reconnecting with old friends like the bar owner Ombul and becoming an important community leader, though he always refused any official political roles.

Under Ord’s guidance, Dalry grew from a small village to a bustling town, and he became affectionately known as the "Blue Man of Dalry." Years passed, and Ord spent many afternoons on the docks, gazing out at the waves, knowing his friends—his family—were out there, continuing their adventures. Twenty-three years after the Bean Team's conclusion, Ombul passed away, and with his death, Ord felt the last remnant of his younger years slipping away. However, Ombul's passing brought Dawn, a former ally, back into his life. They shared stories of their adventures and reminisced about their old comrades, especially Milhorn and Pok.

As more years went by, Ord grew old and frail. One day, a mysterious ship arrived in port, its captain demanding to see the Blue Man of Dalry. Though wary at first, as wizards were known to cause trouble, Ord agreed to meet the captain. To his surprise, the captain was none other than his old friend, Captain Gilligan Firouzeh of the Bean Team. Gilligan had grown into a seasoned man and had formed his own crew, continuing to sail the seas and do good. He had returned to thank Ord and invite him on one last adventure. Though initially hesitant, Ord agreed a few days later.

The night before they were to set sail, a peaceful darkness settled over Ord, and he passed away in his sleep. He left behind a letter addressed to Gilligan, expressing his gratitude for helping him find his purpose and requesting to be buried at sea, alongside the greatest adventure he had ever known. Dalry mourned as Ord’s body was carried to the ship, and he was cast into the sea to be with Dan.

Ord's legacy was twofold: he was the original leader and the glue that held the Bean Team together, the most famous pirate crew in the world, and he was a key figure in the adventuring party that saved the world from ancient evil.
