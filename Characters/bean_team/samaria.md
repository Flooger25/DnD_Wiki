## After Bean Team

In the years following the Bean Team's final adventure, Samaria sought out Emily to reverse the effects of the defiled garnet mixture, a dangerous substance threatening her homeland. Together, they devised a method to absorb the mixture from the seafloor of the Isles, compressing it into a single, powerful gem—the Stone of Life. The people of Venga Isle believed this stone was a divine gift from the sea goddess Calmesto, passed down through their lineage for a millennium, known only to the island's chief.

Recognizing the stone's immense power and the need to protect it from evil, Samaria passed her chiefdom to her younger sister. She shared all her knowledge, including tales of her life as a pirate and a member of the Bean Team. Samaria's final wish was for her sister and the tribe to take the Stone of Life to a remote location in the Isles and create a hidden paradise. She warned that those who knew of the island's location must remain there for the rest of their lives to guard its secret.

Samaria's sister, following her guidance, established the New Calmest Enclave, and with a group of islanders, they transformed a secluded area into a lush, beautiful sanctuary using the Stone of Life. Meanwhile, Samaria and a few others journeyed to the main continent of Praeia, where she was approached by the Mavellian dynasty, who sought peace after enduring the revolutionary turmoil. To protect her people and ensure their safety, Samaria agreed to marry a Mavellian prince, securing their support and shielding her tribe from potential threats.

Samaria continued her druidic studies and maintained correspondence with Emily, deepening her knowledge of healing and herbs. Over time, the Isles were reformed and renamed Commodia, with each island becoming its own state. Due to her lineage from Venga Isle, her reputation as a warrior, and her alliance with Pirate Queen Dawn, Samaria was named Queen of Commodia, serving as a guide for all living beings in the Isles.

Samaria and her husband had three children—two sons and a daughter—who were raised in both Commodian and Mavellian cultures. Her daughter, Teulia, inherited a strong affinity for the garnet stone, continuing the druidic legacy. The children inherited lands in Mavellia, Meridia, and Commodia, with one son becoming a renowned knight.

As time passed, Samaria felt the garnet's energy and the spirits of her ancestors signaling that her time in the mortal realm was ending. She fell ill, and her family and tribe sought to reunite her with her old friends from the Bean Team for a final farewell. However, by the time the message reached them, it was too late. Guided by her connection to the garnet stones, Teulia brought Samaria's body back to the Calmest Enclave, where it was laid to rest, forever protected by the sacred stones from all evil.
