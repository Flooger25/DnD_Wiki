## Backstory

Samaria is the eldest daughter of her village shaman. She is from the [Venga Isle](../../Locations/Land/commodian_isles.md), living in the largest village on the island. The Island worships the forest and the pixies who take care of it. As the daughter of the island shaman, she is tasked with being the ambassador for the island's inhabitants to the pixies and vice versa. She is also in charge of protecting the forest and their traditions. She is paired with a pixie ambassador named Teuila, who is one of the representatives for the pixies. Their journey starts after the forest starts to weaken and they find Colonizers mining the [Garnet stone](../../Objects/garnet_stones.md) which is the heart of the forest and gives the island life. Being the next head shaman on the island Samaria is tasked with solving the mystery and returning the Garnet stones back to the island where they belong. They track the Colonizers back to the city of [Brasshaven](../../Locations/Towns/brasshaven.md) where the stones are being used as a power source. They are traveling by boat and are nearly there.

The Garnet stone is a powerful source of magic. For the island it allows the forest to grow and all life forms to thrive. The islanders all are given a piece of stone to help in their day to day lives which is returned upon their death. The islanders are sought after routinely for their potions and herbs that can only be found on the island. Colonizers from Brasshaven have traveled to the Venga Isle to find out their great secret, what gives them their powers and knowledge that makes them so highly sought after. They come across a cave full of glowing blue/green crystals. They soon realized they found what they were looking for. They soon started a mining operation that would soon explode in scale, shipping the Garnet stones back to Brasshaven to be sold as a power source.

## After Bean Team

In the years following the Bean Team's final adventure, Samaria sought out Emily to reverse the effects of the defiled garnet mixture, a dangerous substance threatening her homeland. Together, they devised a method to absorb the mixture from the seafloor of the Isles, compressing it into a single, powerful gem—the Stone of Life. The people of Venga Isle believed this stone was a divine gift from the sea goddess Calmesto, passed down through their lineage for a millennium, known only to the island's chief.

Recognizing the stone's immense power and the need to protect it from evil, Samaria passed her chiefdom to her younger sister. She shared all her knowledge, including tales of her life as a pirate and a member of the Bean Team. Samaria's final wish was for her sister and the tribe to take the Stone of Life to a remote location in the Isles and create a hidden paradise. She warned that those who knew of the island's location must remain there for the rest of their lives to guard its secret.

Samaria's sister, following her guidance, established the New Calmest Enclave, and with a group of islanders, they transformed a secluded area into a lush, beautiful sanctuary using the Stone of Life. Meanwhile, Samaria and a few others journeyed to the main continent of [Praeia](../../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md#praeia), where she was approached by the [Mavellian dynasty](../../Factions/Nations/mavellian_dynasty.md), who sought peace after enduring the revolutionary turmoil. To protect her people and ensure their safety, Samaria agreed to marry a Mavellian prince, securing their support and shielding her tribe from potential threats.

Samaria continued her druidic studies and maintained correspondence with Emily, deepening her knowledge of healing and herbs. Over time, the Isles were reformed and renamed Commodia, with each island becoming its own state. Due to her lineage from Venga Isle, her reputation as a warrior, and her alliance with Pirate Queen [Dawn](dawn.md), Samaria was named Queen of Commodia, serving as a guide for all living beings in the Isles.

Samaria and her husband had three children—two sons and a daughter—who were raised in both Commodian and Mavellian cultures. Her daughter, Teuila, inherited a strong affinity for the [garnet stone](../../Objects/garnet_stones.md), continuing the druidic legacy. The children inherited lands in Mavellia, Meridia, and Commodia, with one son becoming a renowned knight.

As time passed, Samaria felt the garnet's energy and the spirits of her ancestors signaling that her time in the mortal realm was ending. She fell ill, and her family and tribe sought to reunite her with her old friends from the Bean Team for a final farewell. However, by the time the message reached them, it was too late. Guided by her connection to the garnet stones, Teuila brought Samaria's body back to the Calmest Enclave, where it was laid to rest, forever protected by the sacred stones from all evil.

## Legacy

Samaria's legacy is deeply intertwined with her role as the guardian of her homeland and the spiritual protector of the natural world. As the daughter of a shaman on Venga Isle, Samaria's initial role in the story is tied to her duty to protect the sacred [Garnet Stones](../../Objects/garnet_stones.md), which are vital to the island's life and prosperity. Her connection to the forest and its magic made her an essential figure in the fight against colonizers and invaders who sought to exploit her island's resources.

After joining the [Bean Team](bean_team.md), Samaria's journey became one of balancing her responsibilities to her home with the broader conflicts affecting the world. Her leadership, wisdom, and connection to the spiritual realm helped guide the team through difficult challenges, and her bond with her pixie companion, Teuila, symbolized her deep-rooted connection to the natural world. Samaria's departure with the Bean Team marked a turning point, as she took on more active roles in larger battles, bringing her knowledge and power to aid her comrades.

Samaria's legacy after her time with the Bean Team centers around her enduring role as a protector of Venga Isle and the broader fight against the forces threatening the balance of nature. Even after her departure, her influence remains significant as she continues to safeguard her homeland from exploitation, using the wisdom and strength she gained during her time with the Bean Team. Her actions contribute to preserving the delicate balance between humanity and nature in the world.

In the context of the world, Samaria is remembered as a champion of the environment, a spiritual leader, and a warrior who fought to protect the sacred magic of her people. Her legacy is one of resilience and duty, showing the importance of preserving the natural world in the face of corruption and greed. Through her efforts, Samaria leaves behind a legacy that honors the traditions of her ancestors while influencing the future of the Bean Team and the wider world.
