## Backstory

This is the most evil mailman the world has ever seen. True backstory is as follows:

"Walking into the academy that day I had had enough. Enough of the students picking on me. Enough of being shoved into bags of holding til I couldn’t breathe or lavatories til I couldn’t breathe. But then I saw her, my only friend Tarin, smile at me and wave. She always makes my day, god I love her but if I could only tell her that.

As I ran towards her to show her my drawing I realized she wasn’t waving at me. She was waving at Pierce, the only kid at the academy that had ever tried to kill me. As they embraced and their mouths met, a piece of me broke. I had enough. I would not let myself get hurt anymore and my mind broke.

Walking into the science lab I began to work at my projects mixing volatile chemicals until that green fog started emitting from the pot. I then went to the doors of egress of the school and broke the handles while the building slowly enveloped in a putrid fog. As people began to choke on their own breath I started to swing, one after another they fell before my spells. “This is power,” I thought as they all perished. Then I saw her and I regretted everything.

Tarin’s normally red lips turned blue as she struggled to pull breath. Grabbing her for the first time in my life I willingly went into a bag of holding with her. Holding her in my arms in the bag I felt her draw her last breath. Sobbing over the next hour I felt the air run out of the bag. That was it, I was going to die. As I felt my beautiful mind start to drift out of my body, insanity took over. In my insanity I saw him, the skeletal body held in cloak, as my mind left I felt his will wash over me. He spared me, and now I must serve him.

I killed 1325 children and teachers that day, and for that I must repent and serve. But you see it’s hard to serve when your mind is missing... empty minded some may say.... At this time I had lost all memory of my life prior to the notes and the bags... Passing letters to and fro. For now I must serve him, and should my mind ever return, maybe just maybe I can finally exit his service and die as I should’ve that day. But for now I am Pok the Mailman."


## After Bean Team

In the annals of history, the figure known as Pok, once a companion of the Bean Team, became shrouded in mystery and legend. After the party disbanded, Pok was left adrift, lost in a world that no longer held purpose for him. With no clear direction, he embarked on a journey likened to chasing the wind—a pursuit as aimless and turbulent as the forces of nature themselves. This journey led him to a profound realization: to walk his true path, he needed to relinquish all ties to his worldly life.

Embracing this epiphany, Pok shed his mortal existence, abandoning all but the barest essentials—a cloak, some bones, and a curved staff. In this transformed state, he took on a new role, one that transcended the mortal realm. He became the harbinger of death, the Shepherd of the Dead, and the reaper of souls. His purpose now was to guide the souls of the departed, ensuring they reached their final resting places. Among those he shepherded were his former comrades: Ord, Ormyn, and Samaria, each led to their eternal slumber under his watchful eye.

Pok understood that immortality was a curse rather than a gift, a truth he observed in Dawn, the immortal warrior. He watched as she lived out her endless days, slowly laying to rest the souls she encountered. Pok knew that even for Dawn, immortal death was an inevitable fate. He remained unseen, the yin to her yang, waiting for the day when her time would come. When that day arrived, Pok, the reaper of souls, would be there to guide her to her final place, reuniting her with those she had lost, including the only man Pok ever called brother, Tazirin.

For decades, Pok wandered the desolate wasteland of Limbo, guiding lost souls in his solemn duty. As the years passed, any trace of Pok's existence faded into obscurity, until over thirty years after the conclusion of the Bean Team's adventures, a final will and testament surfaced. Along with it came a secret package, sent to a former member of the Bean Team, a last, enigmatic message from the enigmatic Shepherd of the Dead.
