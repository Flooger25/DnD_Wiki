## Backstory

Ormyn Stonelight has had a privileged life. As a member of the Onyxstone family, money has never been a concern to him. His father Moromund and uncle Aramund are very high rank in the military, and he followed in their footsteps as a medic in the military along with his cousin Diggmund. However, he was not joined in his military pursuits by his other cousin and Diggmund's younger brother [Tazirin](tazirin.md), who abandoned his family and went AWOL. Ormyn served in the military for many years along with his brother Diggmund, but he always wondered what happen to Tazirin. Ormyn became a formidable healer for the military and provided support in many battles. His and Diggmund's ship was apart of the famous [Battle of Helrock](../../Locations/Land/old_world.md#commodian-intervention-186-188), where Ormyn and his crew met a terrible fate. His ship was preparing to reach the battlefield, Ormyn felt a scorching blast from his right and everything went black. Ormyn awoke days later covered in severe burns and bandages in Draycott. Ormyn spent many days healing from his wounds at the Battle of Helrock, and found out that his injuries were due to a massive explosion that occurred on a ship nearby and led to a chain reaction that resulted in the death of his beloved cousin Diggmund. As he healed over time, he spoke his god and questioned himself being in the military. He wanted to blame himself for not being able to save the people on his ship, including Diggmund. His god told him to give himself forgiveness, but he also told him something that he did not expect. Ormyn's god told him that Tazirin has returned to Draycott, and that he must find him and walk in his ways. Ormyn is now torn between abandoning the only thing he has known all his life in the military, or finding Tazirin and trying to figure out why his god wanted him to meet him so bad.

Ormyn was determined at the very least to meet Tazirin before he made his decision, but wanted to rest one more night before he'd do this. Ormyn awoke to the sounds of bells ringing in Draycott and in a panic, he was rushed by Moromund to leave the hospital and to leave Draycott immediately. Ormyn asks his father what is going on, and he finds out the truth is what is happening in Draycott. With this new knowledge of information, Ormyn is still determined that he needs to meet up with Tazirin, and that he must find him today amidst the chaos of Draycott.

## After Bean Team

Upon the completion of the Bean Team's final mission, Ormyn, the cleric dwarf, quietly departed from his comrades. Before leaving, he entrusted each member with a unique item—a signal device that, when snapped in half, would summon him wherever he was needed. This gesture ensured that, despite his departure, he would always be available to aid his friends if called upon.

Embarking on a solitary journey, Ormyn embraced the freedom to explore life on his own terms, no longer bound to the strict dictates of his god. Over time, tales began to circulate of a mysterious cleric dwarf who healed the sick and vanished into the night, his deeds blending with the legendary exploits of the Bean Team. As the years passed, Ormyn's presence in these stories became a subject of debate, with many questioning whether he was truly a member of the famed adventuring party or simply a myth.

Despite his efforts to remain inconspicuous, Ormyn occasionally learned about the fates of his former companions. He heard that Ord had settled in a small town on the main island of Acodela, while Dawn continued to wage battles on the seas in the name of revolution. Samaria had saved her people and found peace, and Pok had mysteriously disappeared, leaving no trace behind.

For over four generations, Ormyn wandered alone, until he eventually settled in a small town in the Isles. This town soon faced a dire threat from a rogue clan of mercenaries, presenting Ormyn with his greatest challenge since his time with the Bean Team. He dedicated himself to preparing the town's humble inhabitants for the impending assault. Though the battle was hard-fought and ultimately successful, Ormyn sustained severe injuries. In his final act of service, he expended his healing powers on the townsfolk, only to be struck down by the last remaining mercenary.

As Ormyn lay dying on the battlefield, he reflected on his life—a life marked by hardship, divine questioning, and moments of profound goodness. In his final moments, as darkness overtook him, his thoughts turned to his family, wondering what life might have been like for his kin, Tazirin and Diggmund, had they lived. He longed to be reunited with them, and after nearly a century, to see his sister once more.

Ormyn realized that he had never been summoned by his former allies in all the years since their last adventure. Initially, he assumed they were simply occupied with their own lives, but as the years stretched on, he understood they had likely passed away. For 88 years, he was not needed by them. Yet, here in this small town, in his final moments, he was needed—and he knew he had done a damn fine job.

## Legacy

Ormyn's legacy is defined by his journey from a privileged military healer to a character caught between personal loss and duty, leaving a significant mark on the world's ongoing struggles. Ormyn was born into the influential Onyxstone family, and his path was shaped by his father and uncle's high-ranking positions in the military. His life of privilege and his role as a medic placed him in many battles, but it was the [Battle of Helrock](../../Locations/Land/old_world.md#commodian-intervention-186-188) that changed him forever.

During the battle, Ormyn's ship was caught in a devastating explosion, and he suffered severe injuries, including the loss of his cousin Diggmund, which led him to question his purpose in the military. His personal struggle to forgive himself for failing to save his comrades became a defining part of his journey. Ormyn's story reflects the broader theme of loyalty and sacrifice, and his actions in battle resonate with the complex emotions of duty, guilt, and redemption.

In the broader context of the world, Ormyn's legacy is one of transformation and reflection. He represents the warriors who grapple with the aftermath of war, and his journey mirrors the struggles of others who live through the consequences of the [Caelian Empire](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md)'s actions and the conflicts it spawns. His role as a healer and his quest for personal forgiveness offer a contrast to the more action-driven characters, showing how healing—both physical and emotional—plays a crucial role in the world's recovery from its long history of violence.

Ormyn's legacy is deeply tied to the moral and ethical dilemmas of the story's world. His internal conflict and desire to seek out his cousin [Tazirin](tazirin.md), after hearing a divine call, highlight his broader impact. While he is not a leader in battle like some of his comrades, his influence comes from his compassion, his struggles with faith, and his dedication to healing the wounds of the world, both literal and figurative.
