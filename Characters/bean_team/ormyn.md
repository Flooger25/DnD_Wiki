## Backstory

## After Bean Team

Upon the completion of the Bean Team’s final mission, Ormyn, the cleric dwarf, quietly departed from his comrades. Before leaving, he entrusted each member with a unique item—a signal device that, when snapped in half, would summon him wherever he was needed. This gesture ensured that, despite his departure, he would always be available to aid his friends if called upon.

Embarking on a solitary journey, Ormyn embraced the freedom to explore life on his own terms, no longer bound to the strict dictates of his god. Over time, tales began to circulate of a mysterious cleric dwarf who healed the sick and vanished into the night, his deeds blending with the legendary exploits of the Bean Team. As the years passed, Ormyn's presence in these stories became a subject of debate, with many questioning whether he was truly a member of the famed adventuring party or simply a myth.

Despite his efforts to remain inconspicuous, Ormyn occasionally learned about the fates of his former companions. He heard that Ord had settled in a small town on the main island of Acodela, while Dawn continued to wage battles on the seas in the name of revolution. Samaria had saved her people and found peace, and Pok had mysteriously disappeared, leaving no trace behind.

For over four generations, Ormyn wandered alone, until he eventually settled in a small town in the Isles. This town soon faced a dire threat from a rogue clan of mercenaries, presenting Ormyn with his greatest challenge since his time with the Bean Team. He dedicated himself to preparing the town’s humble inhabitants for the impending assault. Though the battle was hard-fought and ultimately successful, Ormyn sustained severe injuries. In his final act of service, he expended his healing powers on the townsfolk, only to be struck down by the last remaining mercenary.

As Ormyn lay dying on the battlefield, he reflected on his life—a life marked by hardship, divine questioning, and moments of profound goodness. In his final moments, as darkness overtook him, his thoughts turned to his family, wondering what life might have been like for his kin, Tazirin and Diggmund, had they lived. He longed to be reunited with them, and after nearly a century, to see his sister once more.

Ormyn realized that he had never been summoned by his former allies in all the years since their last adventure. Initially, he assumed they were simply occupied with their own lives, but as the years stretched on, he understood they had likely passed away. For 88 years, he was not needed by them. Yet, here in this small town, in his final moments, he was needed—and he knew he had done a damn fine job.
