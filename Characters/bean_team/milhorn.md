## Backstory

"I spend most of my life in a cycle, to the Loxodon, wisdom is valued above almost all out. I never saw it this way, to me strength is what makes a man. When I came of age I left my tribe and using my giant mass I took to fighting rings where I perfected my craft. That was until it happened, I saw him in the woods. It was Woolyfoot, a giant hairy Loxodon who is legend to live in the woods. Standing at 15’ tall, and close to 2000 pounds, I finally knew what I had to do. I must best him and bring him back to the civilized world where I shall become the best wrestler in the realm."

Milhorn lived amongst a herd of Loxodon on the island of Kelar. When he was little he was dragged off into the woods by Woolyfoot and then woke up one day on the beach with nothing, thus he took to performing as a way to pay his bills.

Bigfoot saved his life.
