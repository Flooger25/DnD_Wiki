## After Bean Team

After the conclusion of the Bean Team's journey, Dawn used the wealth she had acquired to establish a sanctuary on the Isles for any surviving changelings. This haven was meant to be a refuge for those who had suffered, and Dawn, along with her daughter, set sail with the intention of exploring the world. Their first stop was at her old monastery, where she reunited with the head monk and recounted the extraordinary events of her recent adventures. However, Dawn’s respite was short-lived. Revolution erupted in the lands of Ismaia across the South Eastern Sea, setting off a series of conflicts that threatened the safety of many innocents. Unable to stand by, Dawn once again took up the mantle of leadership.

During this tumultuous time, Dawn leveraged her reputation as the Pirate Queen to rally defenders for the Isles, preparing them against potential invaders. She also trained her daughter, Iris, in the arts of combat and leadership, ensuring she would be a powerful warrior in her own right. Additionally, Iris received therapy to help her cope with the challenges they faced. Under Dawn's guidance, the Isles became a sanctuary for the oppressed, further elevating her status as a symbol of revolution, her renown growing to rival that of Six in Meridia.

As the revolutionary wars waned and new governments emerged, Iris grew into adulthood, eventually having children of her own. Dawn, however, began to notice the signs of her own immortality—the gift of a bean she had consumed. While she would never age, her vision began to deteriorate, a fact she confirmed after consulting with her friend Emily. Emily suspected that the visions Dawn experienced—of rain, cold, and flashes of gold—were linked to her condition, though she remained uncertain of their full significance.

Tragedy soon struck when Dawn’s powerful title attracted dangerous enemies. Returning home, she discovered Iris had been murdered in her sleep, likely by an assassin targeting Dawn herself. The trauma unleashed powerful visions of a serpent with a golden eye and a woman with a similar glowing eye. Overcome with grief and rage, Dawn vowed to avenge her daughter's death, her vision worsening further as she pursued the culprits, ultimately uncovering ties to the elite of Mavellia, and even to Cedric Mavell, the husband of her close friend Samaria. This revelation caused a bitter rift between Dawn and Samaria, deepening Dawn's inner turmoil.

Seeking solace, Dawn visited an old friend, Ord, who now ran an inn. Despite the passage of time, Ord’s appearance reminded Dawn of her own agelessness and the reality that her former allies were growing old or passing away. During their conversation, Dawn revealed her worsening vision and the haunting dreams she had been experiencing. Ord speculated that these might be linked to the magical bean or something else beyond their understanding. Buoyed by Ord’s encouragement, Dawn resolved to continue her fight, but as she left, a powerful vision showed her the deaths of all her former comrades, intensifying her dread.

As the years turned to decades, Dawn continued to lead and protect the downtrodden, placing her grandchildren in the monastery for safety. The Bean Team members gradually passed away—first Ord, then Samaria, and finally Ormyn—each death marking the end of an era. Dawn’s visions grew more vivid and disjointed, always accompanied by the need for glasses as her sight continued to fail. With no trace of Emily and the world around her changing irrevocably, Dawn decided to leave her past behind. The final ties to Commodia severed, she chose to journey west to the supercontinent of Praeia, seeking new purpose as the world watched her next move.
