## Backstory

Raised on the far off island of Kazrek, and one of the homelands for the halflings, Gorton grew up in a moderately wealthy family. Due to his older brother being promised the family business, Horton’s Whorehouse and Co, Gorton decided to go to Bard School. After graduating with a degree in lore, Gorton learned of a far off place where many of his people became victims of genocide, so he decided to join a party of raiders intent on freeing as many halflings as they could in Meridia. After Meridia's huge navy was moved away from the coast, the group snuck into land, where they soon began searching for where the halflings have been sent. Soon they realized all the halflings were already dead, and decided to extract revenge since leaving unnoticed seemed impossible.

While on their travel, the Caelian Empire had sent a representative to Kazrek to attempt to obtain the island for a deal, but the rulers refused. The Empire attempted an attack, but since most of their forces were stationed in Western Meridia, they could not conquer the land. Gorton’s people prepared for another invasion.

Meanwhile, Gorton’s strive to complete his adventure and write tales of epic debauchery continued when his group made it to the Eagle’s nest near the capital of the Caelian Empire. His party was put into a deadly position however, only for them to sacrifice themselves to allow Gorton to make his way undetected into the great keep. Gorton would soon run into trouble, but nothing that couldn’t be persuaded to look the other way by magic, or by Gorton’s other “Talents”. Soon, Gorton found the rising party known as “13”, and the rest is history.
