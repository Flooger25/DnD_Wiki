# 13

13 was a legendary band of adventurers based in [Caelus](../../Locations/Land/caelus.md), between 1326 PA and 1344 PA, and the primary protagonists of the [Caelian Trilogy](../../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md) adventuring campaign. They originally banded together to find answers to certain odd events occurring in [Ebrihan](../../Locations/Land/caelus.md#ebrihan), but as 13 discovered the truth, they were revealed to a sinister plot that had been decades, and even centuries, in the making. Through their journey they battled against [Oric Valdes](../oric_valdes.md) and his forces, thus defining a rivalry, and their adventure concluded with their final confrontation with [Arch Witch Kisiri](../kisiri.md) during the [Great Cataclysm](../../Events/great_cataclysm.md) after a revelation of her being the architect of all malicious events in the campaign.
