## Backstory

Zarmoth grew up in a temple of Kelemvor. He eventually became a priest, and started doing exorcisms to let the souls of the dead finally rest. One day, Zarmoth was sent to a strange house with what was assumed to be a ghost, however, when he opened the door, he found himself in a giant ass Tower. When he tried to turn back, the door lead to a particularly hot part of hell, so Zarmoth decided to climb the tower, and look through the doors to a way back to his home, until he meets Troyes.

## Time with 13

## After 13

After the final fight, Zarmoth knew his time with the party was over, so he left for his realm to return to his temple. For the next few years he shared his stories, worshiped his god, and begun research on the demon that Six had sold his soul to. One day he had decided to return to his new world and help with reconstruction of the continents. He had settled in the town in which his new friend Randy had been born and raised, so he focused his efforts there. For the rest of Zarmoth's life he spent time trying to recreate Randy City as an inter-world hub for his people and those on Caelus. He worked closely with Six and Sorin to bring the citizens of the lands back to their former glory, but took every chance he could to spread his religion. Zarmoth had also published a book about his adventures and his journey with the legendary group known as "13" while hiring some of his religious allies to form a group to search Limbo for Six's demon. Zarmoth died a happy man, despite how much more he would liked to have done in his years after the party.
