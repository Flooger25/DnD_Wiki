## Backstory

Sorin was born to nothing. He was found by a small village in a hole in ground soaked in black energy the night of a monster attack. The few survivors of the raid blamed the small baby, saying he was the cause. With his black hair, black nails, and even black tears, it wasn't a stretch to say he did not look like your normal half-elf baby. Before a dagger cut open his stomach, the villagers were stopped by a battalion kingdom's military, as they had come to protect the village from the monsters which had attacked their home. The villagers explained that this baby, who was touched by darkness, was the cause of it all and if sacrificed, would make the monsters go away. The leader of the battalion was unconvinced. Taking the child under the battalion's protection the baby was taken back to their capital city. 

There the little baby was raised by the general's servants. Sorin, named after the general’s grandfather, was adopted and raised in this fairly happy home. At the age of 5, Sorin's magical capabilities started to develop, being able to create light, small flames, basic magic, and without being taught. Sorin also often played with the children of nobles, though many found him scary, once they got to know him he was a truly loveable guy. And where he lacked in physical strength, much to the disappoint of his mother, he made up for in sheer charisma, being able to talk his way into and out of any situation he found himself in, well as much as child could with his hands literally in the cookie jar.
Growing up with the higher echelons of society, Sorin quickly picked up on the subtle bureaucracies of the noble courts, the lying by telling the truth, the back handed compliments, the people who moved a conversation and those who shook one, where to look for favors, etc. And he used to his advantage, being a child no one paid him that much mind and so Sorin was able to work unabated. Those who were his friends he helped grow in stature, but those who scorned him, he made sure to put roadblocks in their way.
By the time he was an adult, Sorin was a master of politics, knowing just when or what to say to get what he wanted out of people, a black tongue dipped in silver. Not to mention his magic, as he grew so did his magic, and after one too many fireballs, his mother forced him to get a teacher to help manage his powers. Through this he was able to pick up more spells and abilities. All was going well for Sorin, for he had just blackmailed a few nobles into owing him a large debt which he used to buy his current staff, but on the walk home the sky turned from its normal hue to black. The sky torn asunder as black tendrils pushed their way through the sky, legions of monsters flooded out the rift and began attacking the kingdom.

Sorin ran to find his mother to make sure she was alright as his own were burned down around him, he fought off as many monsters in his way that we could, but just as he was about to slay a small creature who attacked innocent civilians, he heard a voice in his head.

"You....you are why we are here. Young master, return to us…" Confused and afraid, Sorin clutching his staff and pressing it to the monsters throat asked why they were here to which the monster said, "To bring the young master home."

Sorin looked around, his home on fire, hearing the screams of innocents around him "If I go with you, you will leave this place alone?" The monster nodded, and after casting a Fly spell on himself, followed the black legion into the rift in the sky. Next thing he knew he woke up in the ruins of a large modern city, and was met by its mayor, Taloraan.

## After 13

After Sorin's adventure had concluded, he decided to return to his world. It would have taken him many long months to conjure a way to return, but luckily his party-mate Zarmoth was able to help him get home. Once returned, Sorin spent many years continuing his political campaign to obtain more power, covertly of course. He told stories of his adventure with a party known as "13" and told it like he was the leader, singular hero, and most powerful of the bunch. Everyone fell for it, because it's true of course. After Sorin had achieved nearly full political domination over his kingdom, he began spreading to the world so new to him. He cooperated with Zarmoth in Randy City as an initial base of operations, and had quickly began working with Six as the organized under belly of society. Sorin soon had joined Six in his quest to seek more "infinity" stones, only to discover after years of searching, that one had been found in a remote village from his home kingdom. He took the stone for himself and became immortal like Naddin. Sorin spent the next remaining years basking in the glory of his victories, gaining more political power, and seeking further stones.
