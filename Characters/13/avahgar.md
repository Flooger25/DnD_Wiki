## Backstory

Avahgar was abandoned at birth at the gates of a temple of [Vita](../../Factions/Religions/gods.md#faith-of-the-white), where he was raised. While there, he learned how to heal. Eventually he left the temple to join a group of crusaders, and while with them he learned how to fight. After it became apparent that the group of crusaders where too extreme in their forceful conversions, he left the group. He continued to travel the continent of [Caelus](../../Locations/Land/caelus.md) to learn the wisdoms of the world, until he befriended a particularly interesting group of travelers.

## Time-Skip

During [Oric’s rise](../../Events/rise_of_ebrihan.md), Avahgar went into hiding in Eastern [Meridia](../../Locations/Land/meridia.md), where he would create a temple to the goddess of light, Vita. As the [Caelian Empire](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md)’s power grew, Avahgar felt the light of his live approaching a dark end. During the fall of Eastern Meridia, Avahgar would die fighting the Caelian forces and protecting his temple, providing a quick but noble end.

## Legacy

Avahgar would forever be known as "the hero who sacrificed" as he was the first founding member of 13 to die. Historians wonder how differently events could have played out if 13 was able to reunite with him during the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md)
