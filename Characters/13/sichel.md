## Backstory

Sichel was abandoned at the footsteps of an orphanage when he was a mere baby. After 5 years there, a mysterious figure came to the orphanage looking for promising young children. After a few seemingly mundane tasks were performed, Sichel was chosen and taken by the person. Since Sichel had no place to go he followed. For several days they did not speak as much as Sichel wanted to, curious about this person who had taken him away from his home, only taking time to rest and eat, eventually passing through rugged, untamed terrain Sichel found himself standing at the edge of a water fall with a large building on the very brink, somehow impossibly balancing on torrent of water. There Sichel was raised in the ways of martial arts, he learned of the different schools, open fist, four elements, shadow, etc but Sichel's favorite teacher, Master Kenshin, was a master of the drunken fist so that was what Sichel wanted to learn. Of all the schools though Drunken Fist was unique, it required the student to leave the monastery earlier than the other schools so the monk in training could see out the joys of life, instead of the other schools which tried to distance themselves from earthly desires drunk monks taught that was where strength comes from, knowing what life has to offer so you know why you need to protect it, so when the time was right Sichel left the monastery to find the joys of life.

## Time-Skip

Sichel simply wandered about continuing on his monk journey. He gambled his way into the good graces of some mafia, began dealing fake antique furniture, got out of that to go into entertainment, and eventually started a colosseum in [Fallcrest City](../../Locations/Towns/fallcrest_city.md).

## Legacy

Sichel's legacy was being that of a obtuse chaotic individual who took great risks with minimal reward for his party. His actions made his monastery so bad they had to begin and advertising campaign to bring in new followers. They eventually recovered. He was also disliked by many business owners in Fallcrest City due to his fake antique furniture business, however, the people loved him for he brought much entertainment due to his monster pit colosseum.
