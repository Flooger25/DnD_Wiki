## Backstory

Burk’s family were well known carpenters in the orc community. This caught the attention of other races, which led to the family business being contracted out of the Northern Fields. Because of the dangers of the road, Burk had to learn to fight very early on. For political reasons yet to be known, the Kvak family felt a rising tension against their people, so Burk was pushed to venture out of the business to try and help resolve the conflict if he could, for he had no knowledge of what terrors are to come.

## Time with "10"

## Time-Skip

After Ten’s defeat, Burk knew his family, being non-human, was in danger. He hauled ass back to them and saved them from a small raid of the Imperator’s forces. He explained what was going on, and they gathered all of their most important shit and headed for Meridia, hoping to find refuge there. They narrowly escaped capture and death, and made it to a ship of mostly human refugees fleeing the continent. They were already over capacity but Burk forced their way onto the ship. Sometime terrible had occurred, however.

Perhaps because they resented his family for it, or perhaps because it was their plan all along, the other refugees sold the Kvaks out to the Empire’s forces. A few days in, in the dead of night, a war ship came for the vessel. Hoping to appease the enemy, the humans on board banded together, and easily overpowered the minorities on board to offer to the troops. However, when the ship was boarded, the enemy commander started laughing and ordered everyone to be slaughtered. Amidst the chaos Burk could do nothing but watch as all of the refugees were overrun and Burk’s family was brutally slain one by one. The rest of the night was a blur of fighting, until finally Burk was struck down and fell overboard, and as darkness took over his sense of vision, he sank beneath the waves and the flaming ship.

Burk somehow awoke the next morning on the outskirts of an island with natives looking over him. With their assistance, he managed to make it to Western Meridia, where he attempted to warn the leaders there of everything happening on Caelus, and what had transpired of his journey. Burk found work at a local construction company, but felt nothing but emptiness as he worked his way up through the ranks. Without his family, he had lost all purpose in life, and was just waiting to die.

11 years had passed, and when Western Meridia fell under attack, the company Buk worked for found themselves overloaded with work to help the war effort. This went on for several years until Burk heard of the death of an old friend. Having nothing left to lose, he simply vanished one day toward the funeral. Thus, unbeknownst to him, this decision led him to the next chapter in his life.

## Time with 13

## After 13

After the defeat of Kisiri, several thoughts begin to linger in Burk's mind. That of his mortality and Fraemia. He thinks on its power and importance in the realm, and how it should be carefully taken care of before its passing, so he divides himself from "13" to travel to the very north of the Northern Fields. He arrives to a small fishing settlement, and asks for passage as far north into the great ocean that he can go. He meets a fellow aged Orc who seems to recognize and understand the burden and history Burk has experienced, so he obliges. Before their journey, Burk distributes his 75K gold to the poor people in the village, and then sails off into the north. After several days, Burk arrives to a small island with a single cottage, and chooses to spend the remainder of his days alone until his death. During his last months of self-reflection, he hides away Fraemia on the island, not to protect it but to protect the world from it.
