## Backstory

Nad is a dwarf who lived in a small town in Meridia and believes there is someone out there he one day will train to be a hero like him and his master before him and their master before him. He, unlike most of the dwarves he grew up with who were more focused on mining and only worrying about themselves, had a sense of adventure and felt a pull to attempt to help others the best he could. Nad didn't have anyone for family, so he always tried to make friends even at the boarding house where the other orphan's lived.

One day in his youth, he was walking back to town when he noticed someone getting raided by bandits. Even though he was completely outnumbered, he moved without even thinking and fought tooth and nail to save the person. He held on for as long as he could until one of the raiders knocked him unconscious. Later he awoke in a small cottage bandaged up barely able to move, he met his soon to be teacher who had seen his act of heroism and decided to teach him in the ways of a paladin.

After years of training, Nad returned to his small hometown and stayed there for years helping those in need until eventually he decided he wasn't getting any younger, and that it was time for him to find his very own successor.

## Time-Skip

From 1326 to 1343 PA, Nad meets an aspiring hero named Mason and decides to make him his successor. While Masonâ€™s training approaches completion, Nad has a dream where his master came to him and told him Evil is manifesting more and more and Mason would most likely perish if it is not stopped, so immediately Nad decides to come out of retirement and save the people he can, including Mason.

## After 13

Naddin's conclusion was simple yet justified. After his departure from the other members of the legendary group known as [13](13.md), he decided to stay on the down low. He traveled his homeland and [Meridia](../../Locations/Land/meridia.md) as a vagabond. He would casually help those in need, only to disappear the next day. He would arrive to random towns as a mysterious figure to help reconstruct buildings or slay local fiends summoned by [Kisiri](../kisiri.md), and leave without sharing his identity. When he had the chance, he would reunite with his apprentice, Mason, and teach him everything he knew, so he could become the better paladin. He went down in history as the man who disappeared, but given his stance against mortality, it is rumored he still wanders the lands of Meridia to this day.

## Legacy

Naddin's legacy was being one of, if not, the most powerful members of 13, which carried significant weight. Scholars who have spent years studying their adventure debate on the strengths and weaknesses of [Six](six.md) and Naddin respectively, often citing Naddin as the strength of the party and Six being the offense focused leader. Regardless, Naddin has gone down in history as a mythological and standard silent hero archetype.

In addition many folk tales have emerged surrounding Naddin's whereabouts. Some say he secretly heals those in the dead of the night in Meridia while others suggest he lurks in the shadows to protect those in the wild lands of the [Old World](../../Locations/Land/old_world.md). Scholars have agreed that he most likely has either died in combat or is retired in a far off place where he will never be seen again.
