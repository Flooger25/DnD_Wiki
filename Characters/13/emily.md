## Backstory

Emily was born in 1333 PA in Fallcrest City. Her mother died in childbirth, but her father raised her alone while owning and working a general store in the city. Unfortunately for her father, Emily was born during the year in which Northern Meridia was invaded by the [Caelians](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md) in the second year of the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md).

## After 13

In the chronicles of Eastern Meridia, Emily's perspective offers a unique and personal lens through which the era of the Mors Marauders and their enigmatic leader, Six, can be understood. Following the dramatic end of the [Caelian Trilogy](../../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md), Emily found herself at a pivotal moment in history. Accompanied by [Six](six.md), she returned to the remnants of the Mors Marauders’ base, only to discover it in ruins, having been devastated by the sorceress [Kisiri](../kisiri.md). As the highest-ranking and most experienced member of the [Marauders](../../Factions/Organizations/mors_marauders.md), Six seized this moment to take command and begin the arduous task of rebuilding the organization.

Emily witnessed firsthand the remarkable transformation that ensued. Under Six’s leadership, the Marauders not only recovered but thrived, combating the demonic forces that had overrun Eastern Meridia. This period of restoration and resurgence was marked by significant progress, as Six’s strategic acumen and formidable influence attracted new members and restored the Marauders' prominence.

During this time, Six made a significant decision that would profoundly impact Emily’s life. Recognizing the inevitability of his own mortality, he sought out a powerful necromancer and invested substantial resources to create a clone of Emily. This act was driven by his desire to ensure her continued presence and partnership, even as he pursued his own quest for immortality.

Emily’s role evolved as Six’s ambitions grew. When [Sorin](sorin.md) reappeared, their alliance led them on a quest for the legendary [Infinity Stones](../../Objects/prismatic_gems.md), an endeavor that spanned decades. Emily, alongside Six and Sorin, engaged in a relentless search that eventually resulted in Sorin obtaining immortality through one of the stones. After nearly a century of searching, Six’s forces discovered another stone, securing his own immortality and solidifying their collective power.

With their newfound eternal status, Six, Sorin, and Emily undertook a daring mission to reclaim Six’s lost soul. Emily’s perspective on this journey was marked by both danger and determination. The quest led them through the treacherous plane of [Limbo](../../Locations/Planes/limbo.md), where they faced formidable challenges, including a dramatic confrontation with the [Centipede Demon](../centipede_demon.md) in the Bone Cathedral. The eventual agreement to return Six’s soul in exchange for the moonblade demonstrated the high stakes and the intricate negotiations required to achieve their goals.

In the later years, Six’s innovative use of Emily’s magical abilities to create a simulacrum of himself allowed him to continue his dual pursuits. While his simulacrum managed the public face of their dominion, the real Six indulged his passion for battle and adventure. Emily was instrumental in these endeavors, assisting in the creation of a massive dungeon and curating its contents to provide challenges for future adventurers.

Throughout this prolonged period, Emily’s role was both supportive and integral to Six’s grand vision. As centuries passed, Six’s legendary status as the leader of the Mors Marauders and a dominant figure in Meridia became firmly established. Emily’s enduring partnership with Six, her experiences in battles, and her involvement in the intricate plans of their immortal journey offer a compelling narrative of loyalty, adventure, and the relentless pursuit of legacy.
