# Emily

Emily, of [13](13.md), was an incredibly powerful autistic bard who was the adopted daughter of adventuring legend [Six](six.md). After being adopted in the middle of 13's adventure, she learned the ropes as to how to be a bard and excelled at it. She assisted in 13's final confrontation against Arch Witch [Kisiri](../kisiri.md), saving the world against destruction.

Afterwards she became a political partner to Six by helping him rebuild [Meridia](../../Locations/Land/meridia.md) from the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md) and solidifying his power in the region. She eventually branched out to become a researcher of magical artifacts and rare powers. Through this she gained infamy as being a legendary scientist and pioneer of discovery.

Sometime during the 3rd century of the 5th Age she went missing and has yet to be seen.

## Backstory

Emily was born in 1333 PA in [Fallcrest City](../../Locations/Towns/fallcrest_city.md). Her mother died in childbirth, but her father raised her alone while owning and working a general store in the city. Unfortunately for her father, Emily was born during the year in which Northern Meridia was invaded by the [Caelians](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md) in the second year of the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md).

## After 13

In the chronicles of Eastern Meridia, Emily's perspective offers a unique and personal lens through which the era of the Mors Marauders and their enigmatic leader, Six, can be understood. Following the dramatic end of the [Caelian Trilogy](../../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md), Emily found herself at a pivotal moment in history. Accompanied by [Six](six.md), she returned to the remnants of the Mors Marauders’ base, only to discover it in ruins, having been devastated by the sorceress [Kisiri](../kisiri.md). As the highest-ranking and most experienced member of the [Marauders](../../Factions/Organizations/mors_marauders.md), Six seized this moment to take command and begin the arduous task of rebuilding the organization.

Emily witnessed firsthand the remarkable transformation that ensued. Under Six’s leadership, the Marauders not only recovered but thrived, combating the demonic forces that had overrun Eastern Meridia. This period of restoration and resurgence was marked by significant progress, as Six’s strategic acumen and formidable influence attracted new members and restored the Marauders' prominence.

During this time, Six made a significant decision that would profoundly impact Emily’s life. Recognizing the inevitability of his own mortality, he sought out a powerful necromancer and invested substantial resources to create a clone of Emily. This act was driven by his desire to ensure her continued presence and partnership, even as he pursued his own quest for immortality.

Emily’s role evolved as Six’s ambitions grew. When [Sorin](sorin.md) reappeared, their alliance led them on a quest for the legendary [Infinity Stones](../../Objects/prismatic_gems.md), an endeavor that spanned decades. Emily, alongside Six and Sorin, engaged in a relentless search that eventually resulted in Sorin obtaining immortality through one of the stones. After nearly a century of searching, Six’s forces discovered another stone, securing his own immortality and solidifying their collective power.

With their newfound eternal status, Six, Sorin, and Emily undertook a daring mission to reclaim Six’s lost soul. Emily’s perspective on this journey was marked by both danger and determination. The quest led them through the treacherous plane of [Limbo](../../Locations/Planes/limbo.md), where they faced formidable challenges, including a dramatic confrontation with the [Centipede Demon](../centipede_demon.md) in the Bone Cathedral. The eventual agreement to return Six’s soul in exchange for the moonblade demonstrated the high stakes and the intricate negotiations required to achieve their goals.

In the later years, Six’s innovative use of Emily’s magical abilities to create a simulacrum of himself allowed him to continue his dual pursuits. While his simulacrum managed the public face of their dominion, the real Six indulged his passion for battle and adventure. Emily was instrumental in these endeavors, assisting in the creation of a massive dungeon and curating its contents to provide challenges for future adventurers.

Throughout this prolonged period, Emily’s role was both supportive and integral to Six’s grand vision. As centuries passed, Six’s legendary status as the leader of the Mors Marauders and a dominant figure in Meridia became firmly established. Emily’s enduring partnership with Six, her experiences in battles, and her involvement in the intricate plans of their immortal journey offer a compelling narrative of loyalty, adventure, and the relentless pursuit of legacy.

## Commodian Tales

During the [Commodian Tales](../../Campaigns/commodian_tales.md) adventure Emily was encountered by the adventuring party known as the [Bean Team](../bean_team/bean_team.md). In their encounter it was discovered Emily was experimenting with the Wish spell in an attempt to learn it. Unfortunately when she was finally able to cast it she was thinking about consuming beans so she turned magical artifacts into beans of different colors, and this somehow included turning some individual creatures into talking, and anthropomorphized, animal people. Between meeting the Bean Team and casting the wish spell she spent her time trying to collect creatures who turned and beans. She even hired some of these creatures to go out and search for the beans.

After the Bean Team's adventure she worked with [Samaria](../bean_team/samaria.md) to reverse the effects of the engineered [garnet mixture](../../Objects/garnet_stones.md#garnet-mixture). In addition to assisting Samaria, she was also sought out by [Dawn](../bean_team/dawn.md) to determine why she was not aging. It turns out the golden bean Dawn consumed on her adventure brought her to life via resurrection magic but also granted her ageless immortality. Emily was also told about visions Dawn was experiencing and became curious as to what this could be. Before Emily's disappearance she determined Dawn may be experiencing the identical nature of [Burk's Eye](../13/burk.md).

## Legacy

Emily's legacy would forever be tied to [Six](six.md) in both positive and negative. As his right hand person, she would carry out the orders and guidance of Six as he took control of and rebuilt Meridia after the [war](../../Events/meridian_wars.md). However, she was also his closest aid and had a great impact on the strategic decisions he made.

Beyond this she was well renowned in the regions she frequented as a highly intelligent scientist and person who helps the downtrodden. She was the most liked by the people between her and Six.
