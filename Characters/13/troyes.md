## Backstory

Troyes' bloodline hails from the natives of [Caelus](../../Locations/Land/caelus.md), and as such has spent most of his life away from civilization living on the land hunting beasts and gathering plants, his home village did very little farming so it was necessary. But Troyes had always been curious about the others in his homeland, and unlike most of his village he did not hate the so called "invaders", and as such he set out to learn more about people. Unfortunately Troyes fell to some of the bad practices of his new friends, and gets a little too hooked to intoxicants and women.

## Time-Skip

After the party separated Troyes figured the best way to protect himself would be to, as they say, hide in a tree in a forest. He removed the tribal tattoos, trimmed his hair, and learned to speak the common tongue properly. Troyes also got a job making furniture as a woodcarver and tanner, keeping his skills in tact by occasionally going hunting for dangerous beasts who roam nearby.

## After 13

Troyes returns to his village and reunites with his family, who thankfully have survived the Arch Witch. He settles down once more and spends the next few years of his remaining 20-30 helping to rebuild the village and a few neighboring in the area. He eventually decides to begin training his daughters in the way of the ranger and fighter, so that they may protect themselves. Others in the village respect Troyes' power and history as an adventurer, so he trains others in his ways. News spreads of a member of the legendary [13](13.md) training locals in the [Ebrihan](../../Locations/Land/caelus.md#ebrihan) region, so Troyes obliges these requests as long as they prove their strength and resolve. His furniture making business grows as citizens' homes are rebuilt, but he keeps it modest just to survive and provide for his family. At the age of 72, Troyes dies peacefully in his sleep, with the knowledge of his own heroism and acts of kindness he had done both locally and throughout the region.

## Legacy

Troyes will forever be known as one of the primary members of 13. In addition to his efforts in rebuilding Ebrihan and providing training to locals, he thus became a historical hero to the Caelian people decades into the 5th Age. Due to the effects from his mythology, the skills of rangers have become a central part of [Ebrihanian](../../Locations/Land/caelus.md#ebrihan) culture. Even to this day the region is exporting its skills to the rest of the known world. Some today believe they can trace powerful ranger's back to Troyes' lineage.
