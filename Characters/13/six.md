# Six

Six is a wood elf blood hunter born in Northern Meridia in 1028 PA (2284 4A) who was famously known as the leader of the legendary adventuring company [13](13.md). At an early age Six was recruited and trained as a bounty hunter under the organization [Mors Marauders](../../Factions/Organizations/mors_marauders.md), named after the Caelian god of death. He eventually came across a band of adventurers and soon what would be later known as 13 was founded. He soon became the leader, and the rest was history.

## Backstory

At some point 300+ years prior to Six’s birth, the group now known as the Mors Mauraders secretly came across an ancient tablet written with unknown symbols. No one could ever figure out what it meant or what it was for, but the Monastery of Jubilance in the mountains of Athal knew it was powerful enough that they had to lock it away in the mountains, for no one to find it.

Six was born to an Elf family in Meridia nearly 300 years prior to our story. While a newborn, his parents asked for a bounty on a high value target, but couldn’t pay the high cost they had promised to fulfill, so to pay the debt, the bounty hunter group, took Six and proclaimed that he is to pay off his family’s debt through bounty hunting services. The group of bounty hunters consisted of worshippers of Mors, and are aptly named the Mors Mauraders. As Six grew to adulthood, he was trained, given the nickname Six, and he fulfilled contracts until he met up with the party. He continues to aspire to pay off his debt and become a more efficient killer.

## After 13/Post-Caelian Trilogy

After the events of the [Caelian Trilogy](../../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md), the members of 13 parted ways, while Six made sure to note how old everyone at the time was. Six took [Emily](emily.md) back to the Mors Marauders base of operations. When he arrived he learned the Big 3 in the Marauders had been taken out by [Kisiri](../kisiri.md). Six being the highest ranked/most experienced saw the opportunity to take the reigns of the organization. Very, very few of the members remained, but Six used his influence to gather the leftover forces to clear out the demons and devils Kisiri had brought into the world. This gave the Mors Marauders a lot of popularity and new members.

This continued for about 3 decades. Six was leading the rebuilding of the Marauders and the rebuilding of Eastern Meridia, with himself as the head, and with this new found power Six began to start on his real plans. He sought out a powerful yet secluded necromancer and handsomely paid him to cast the clone spell on Emily. Knowing she would not live as long as him this would allow her to become a form of immortal.

After that Six was nearing complete control of Eastern Meridia and he heard that [Sorin](sorin.md) had come back into the plane. The two of them met and realized the other had conquered their domain, the two decided to combine their resources. Six knew that [Troyes](troyes.md), [Zarmoth](zarmoth.md), and [Burk](burk.md) had died of natural causes by this point, and besides [Naddin](naddin.md), they were all that were left of the final iteration of 13. The two decided they would set out to find infinity stones to achieve immortality as Naddin had.

After another few decades, about a century has past since the battle of 13 and Kisiri with Six being 420 at this point (blaze it with Gandank to celebrate). Sorin’s men are the first to find a stone and with it Sorin achieves immortality. The 2 continue to search and after about almost 8 decades and many planes being searched, Six’s men find another stone.

184 years after Kisiri’s defeat, Six, Sorin, and Emily have achieved their immortality through one way or another. Six is the most recognized name in the land as: the old leader of the Heroes 13, the leader of the Mors Marauders (a massive bounty hunting organization), and the leader of many parts of Meridia. Six asks Sorin and Emily to help him return to Limbo to retake his soul he sold. They successfully plane shift and retrace their steps to find Sichel's body in the Spire for the magic tomes he held after several weeks.

The three then set out for the Bone Cathedral, now having their bearings they hunt down the [demon with Six’s soul](../centipede_demon.md). The battle rages and nearly kills everyone, but in the final round the demon strikes a deal to return Six's soul in return for the moonblade. The deal is accepted and the three head out of the plane of Limbo.

At this point, Six and Sorin have everything they need to stay in power of Meridia and Randy City, as well as the underground society.

Six uses Emily to cast Simulacrum on himself. The duplicate of Six becomes the face of the country while the real one follows his true passions. Being the ruler of all you can see is fun and all, but the thrill of battle is unmatched. Simu-six takes his place in society while secretly taking commands from the real Six and informing him of what's going on in his country.

The real Six has been using many resources and people to excavate an old massive dungeon. After clearing it out Six and Emily move in to start stowing all the riches from the years, finding monsters and mercenaries to submit to his power and serve in this dungeon. Purely for fun, waiting for parties similar to his old, to let them fight a real boss.

Hundreds of years past the death of Kisiri, Six was the most recognized name of the land, as the leader of the Mors Marauders, many parts of Meridia, and leader of the legendary party "13", Six's name was remembered forever. By this point, his story was over...or was it?
