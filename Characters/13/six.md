## Backstory

At some point 300+ years prior to Six’s birth, the group now known as the Mors Mauraders secretly came across an ancient tablet written with unknown symbols. No one could ever figure out what it meant or what it was for, but the Monastery of Jubilance in the mountains of Athal knew it was powerful enough that they had to lock it away in the mountains, for no one to find it.

Six was born to an Elf family in Meridia nearly 300 years prior to our story. While a newborn, his parents asked for a bounty on a high value target, but couldn’t pay the high cost they had promised to fulfill, so to pay the debt, the bounty hunter group, took Six and proclaimed that he is to pay off his family’s debt through bounty hunting services. The group of bounty hunters consisted of worshippers of Mors, and are aptly named the Mors Mauraders. As Six grew to adulthood, he was trained, given the nickname Six, and he fulfilled contracts until he met up with the party. He continues to aspire to pay off his debt and become a more efficient killer.

## Time with 13

## After 13

As the leader of the infamous "13", Six knew after the death of Kisiri, things would be different forever. The party split off, each member pursuing their own paths until their death, so Six did the same. Immediately after their adventure, Six turned in his bounty and assumed command of his organization, the Mors Marauders. For the next few decades, Six used his fame, power, and rule over the Marauders to help in reconstruction in Eastern Meridia and grow his organization exponentially. In order to keep Emily immortal, Six began his own adventure to seek someone who could do it, but he ended up with a powerful, yet secluded, necromancer, who was forced to use the Clone spell on Emily, extending her age artificially. While Sorin had begun working with Zarmoth in Randy City, Six had gained nearly complete control over Eastern Meridia, but after hearing of Sorin's return, he reestablished his relationship to work with him as an ally for the foreseeable future. By the time half of the party had passed of natural causes, Six's goal to find further "infinity" stones had begun. His ally Sorin was able to find one, but Six was only able to find ancient and cryptic information on them, but he would never give up his search while in power, so he had sent members of the Marauders over the years to cover the world and other dimensions. Hundreds of years past the death of Kisiri, Six was the most recognized name of the land, as the leader of the Mors Marauders, many parts of Meridia, and leader of the legendary party "13", Six had decided to create a dungeon with his own rules. By this time, Six would retire as a dungeon master, only to wait for a group of adventurers who dare seek his riches or to stumble upon him.
