# Miirakail

Miirakail was an Ancient Silver Dragon who inhabited the continent of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md) before all others, which gave him the nickname among some as the father of the continent. Miirakail was unique among many dragons not only for his long life, but also for his infamous golden eyes that gave him the power of clairvoyance. During his life, his left eye was stolen and used by [Arch Witch Kisiri](kisiri.md) as a method for her to become more powerful, and later on Miirakail was able to use the rest of the power in his right eye to send [13](13/13.md) back in time to learn the power of the [Imperator](oric_valdes.md).

## Description

Because of his age, Miirakail was colossal in size, with his hands alone being upwards of 20 feet wide. In addition, when in the darkness, a visitor may witness his presence by noticing his golden eyes illuminating an outline of his face. His physical characteristics aside, despite being a silver dragon, Miirakail was actually quite irritable and impatient. He cared not for life around him, for he was aged and had seen the horrors mortals inflict upon the world. This could explain how reclusive he was to the peoples of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md)

## History

One scholar made the claim that Miirakail originated not from Caelus, but merely arrived there before all others for the earliest evidence of his existence dates back later than his theorized age of 2000-2500 years. If true, some say he comes from across the [Great Ocean](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md#great-ocean) or from another plane of existence.

Scholars have also wondered where and how Miirakail obtained his clairvoyant eyes, specifically whether he was born with them or gifted. What they can agree on, however, is that it seems he was blessed by a God directly, thus giving him the abilities.

## Powers

Miirakail was of considerable strength due to his age as a dragon and his abilities with his clairvoyant eyes. His base states matched that of an Ancient Silver Dragon with [epic stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8ibq5q/5e_epic_monster_updates_v13/), and with his golden eyes equipped, he gained the permanent ability of the spell [Foresight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/foresight).
