# Airgar

Airgar was a former White Knight of the [King of the Dominion](aluuard_vidroth.md), father of Princess [Eilis Vidroth II](eilis_vidroth.md), and youngest brother to [Lord Belda](saywin_belda.md). He was born during the [War of the Fields](../Events/war_of_the_fields.md) but lived safely behind the borders of [Athal](../Locations/Land/caelus.md#athal). Given his family's aristocratic connections, he grew up with the royal guardsman and trained to be a protector of the royal family. He matured parallel to a member of the royal family, Samantha Vidroth, and later had a secret love with her, which led to the birth of future princess [Eilis](eilis_vidroth.md).
