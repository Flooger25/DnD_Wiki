## Description

Rystrasz was a colossal Wyrm Red Dragon whose size rivaled that of castles. When he was released again in 1344 PA, he could wrap his body around medium sized modern buildings with his wings blocking out vision of the sky for an observer below. Like [Miirakail](miirakail.md), he was so large his head was easily the size of a large store in a city, and his hands big enough to hold several oxen. Very few dragons are known to have ever achieved the age, physical size, and power of a dragon like Rystrasz, and because of that many consider him one of the most powerful dragons of all time, except for the dragon gods.

Beyond his strength, Rystrasz was known for his split personality and love of rock music. His two personalities seemed to always be infighting with one another, thus driving his sporadic behavior. One personality was fiendish, dark, evil, and loved destruction, all of which could be deduced from the dark things he would say to others in his deep voice. The other personality was much different, for it was flamboyant and showed a fascination for living creatures, and often offered services to those he'd come across with the hopes of making friends. Despite how opposite Rystrasz's personalities were, they both shared an obsessive love for music, and especially rock music. This was his biggest weakness.

## History

### Origin

It is unknown when Rystrasz was born, but based on his size and observed strength, it is deduced his age was of several thousands of years, even surpassing that of [Miirakail](miirakail.md). To live such a long life, Rystrasz would have had to kill and consume thousands of creatures, requiring massive devastation to civilizations abroad. There is little record of a beast of Rystrasz's stature existing on [Pulchra](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md) until the [Great Cataclysm](../Events/great_cataclysm.md), therefore his victims must have been from alternative dimensions or before recorded history altogether.

### Limbo

It is not known exactly when, where, and for how long Rystrasz inhabited [Limbo](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md), but what is known is long before the Great Cataclysm, he was trapped below ruins of the [Ruined City](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md#ruined-city). Later, by an unknown figure, the Wandering Weald's life-stone was hidden in his chamber knowing it would be protected by the great dragon's blind hatred for intruders.

Some time in 1289 PA, Rystrasz was encountered by the Silver Guardians. The party was doomed to be incinerated, but with the wits and cunning of their leader, [Oric Valdes](oric_valdes.md#silver-guardians), he was outsmarted and the Guardians had just enough time for them to gain information on [Miirakail](miirakail.md)'s whereabouts and escape. This event made Rystrasz remember the name Oric for an eternity, vowing to destroy him for tricking him into saying rock music was "boring."

Years later, in 1344 PA during the events of [Ascension of the Ancient](../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md#ascension-of-the-ancient), Rystrasz was encountered by a legendary, albeit similarly rambunctious, group known as [13](13/13.md) when they accidentally came upon his prison. It is revealed the group is looking for the life-stone in the box, so he makes a deal with them to play music for him in return for the box. Secretly, he has learned that just enough musical sound needs to be played to turn the power that holds him there into an aberration, which can then be killed to be released. 13 play a concert for him, [the aberration](brasstard.md) is formed and killed, and then Rystrasz finally becomes free.

Feeling thankful and mercy for the first time in thousands of years, Rystrasz chooses to not destroy 13, but rather to give them a gift for releasing him, a tablet that when broken summons him to their aid.

### Great Cataclysm

Not long after being released, 13 breaks Rystrasz's tablet, thus summoning him. Unbeknownst to the dragon, the tablet breaker, [Sorin](13/sorin.md), was under the control of [Kisiri](kisiri.md), and instead fell to the ground below the floating ruins of Kisirith to fight the Titan.

While 13 and friends were duking it out with Kisiri during the final fight of the [Caelian Trilogy](../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md), Rystrasz was making friends with the Titan. Unfortunately, however, Rystrasz was out matched for the Titan had a stronger defense than his offense. Fairly soon Rystrasz fell, thus ending his several thousand year existence, and saving the lives of all he could destroy.

## Powers

Rystrasz was a great red dragon whose powers were limited to the same kinds of abilities as an ancient red dragon, however his were substantially more amplified, making him immensely more powerful and dangerous.

Rystrasz was also not known as a mage by any means, despite that some of the great dragons had further magical abilities.
