## Description

Rystrasz was a colossal Wyrm Red Dragon whose size rivaled that of castles. When he was released again in 1344 PA, he could wrap his body around medium sized modern buildings with his wings blocking out vision of the sky for an observer below. Like [Miirakail](miirakail.md), he was so large his head was easily the size of a large store in a city, and his hands big enough to hold several oxen. Very few dragons are known to have ever achieved the age, physical size, and power of a dragon like Rystrasz, and because of that many consider him one of the most powerful dragons of all time, except for the dragon gods.

Beyond his strength, Rystrasz was known for his split personality and love of rock music. His two personalities seemed to always be infighting with one another, thus driving his sporadic behavior. One personality was fiendish, dark, evil, and loved destruction, all of which could be deduced from the dark things he would say to others in his deep voice. The other personality was much different, for it was flamboyant and showed a fascination for living creatures, and often offered services to those he'd come across with the hopes of making friends. Despite how opposite Rystrasz's personalities were, they both shared an obsessive love for music, and especially rock music. This was his biggest weakness.

## History

### Origin

It is unknown when Rystrasz was born, but based on his size and observed strength, it is deduced his age was of several thousands of years, even surpassing that of [Miirakail](miirakail.md). To live such a long life, Rystrasz would have had to kill and consume thousands of creatures, requiring massive devastation to civilizations abroad. There is little record of a beast of Rystrasz's stature existing on [Pulchra](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md) until the [Great Cataclysm](../Events/great_cataclysm.md), therefore his victims must have been from alternative dimensions or before recorded history altogether.

### Limbo

Some time in 1289 PA, Rystrasz was encountered by the Silver Guardians. The party was doomed to be incinerated, but with the wits and cunning of their leader, [Oric Valdes](oric_valdes.md#silver-guardians), he was outsmarted and trapped in the mountains of the flats of [Limbo](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md) long enough for the group to gain information on [Miirakail](miirakail.md)'s whereabouts and retreat. This event made Rystrasz remember the name Oric for an eternity, vowing to destroy him for tricking him into saying rock music was "boring."

Years later, in 1344 PA during the events of [Ascension of the Ancient](../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md#ascension-of-the-ancient), Rystrasz was encountered by a legendary, albeit similarly rambunctious, group known as [13](13/13.md) when they accidentally came upon the lair in which he was trapped.
