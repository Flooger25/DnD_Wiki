## Description

A prismatic gem is shaped and feels like an egg made of smooth glass, and is about the size of an adult human's fist. It is transparent like a marble, and within the center of the gem is multicolored light that moves in an animated fashion. The prismatic light streaks from the center of the gem like cracks in glass. The gems are very hard as well, for the most powerful of axes cannot shatter it. If one is to attempt to break it, they risk breaking their own tools, for these gems are indestructible.

## Powers

The power of these items is not completely understood, however, it is known that a stone is capable of giving its attuned user two epic boons and two minor beneficial properties.

## History

## Reputation

It is not known how exactly it works, but when a user of a stone passes, and is attuned to the stone or whatever artifact is created from it, the stone disappears and is dispersed among the cosmos in a seemingly random fashion. The gems cannot be broken, but rumors suggest a weapon made from a gem poses the best chance.

It is also unknown as to how many stones exist, but at minimum there are 6 as indicated [below](#notable-owners).

## Notable Owners

6 gems were found and given to [High Lord Valdes](../Characters/oric_valdes.md) between the years 1326 and 1343 PA. After his assassination, these stones were found and given to [13](../Characters/13/13.md). During the events of Ascension of the Ancient, one of these stones were lost due to [Sichel](../Characters/13/sichel.md)'s death in the [Spire](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md#spire), and one more was nearly lost due to the death of [Gorton](../Characters/13/gorton.md) soon after, however, in total 5 were held onto and eventually used to forge weapons that 13 used to destroy [Arch Witch Kisiri](../Characters/kisiri.md).
