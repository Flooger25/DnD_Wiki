# Fraemia - The Lightning Spear

The lightning spear known as Fraemia is a weapon forged by the Gods and stolen from [Anduin](../Characters/anduin_the_great.md). It is considered by scholars the most powerful weapon wielded by a mortal of all time.

"Even the utterance of such verbiage send shivers down my spine. How could the Gods allow such a thing to exist or even befall into the hands of mortals? Is it a cruel joke? A mistake? A final warning for us and our sins? We may never know. What I do know, however, is such a thing is only a curse. If one is to come across a golden spear of light, it is time to seek their family for the world shall soon end." -- Unknown Meridian historian, circa 1st century of the 5th Age.

NOTE: Fraemia is the Ring of Power of Pulchra

## Description

Fraemia is a golden spear with a tip that shares a resemblance to a dragonslayer swordspear. Engraved along the entire object are various symbols, with some being translated as symbols atop the different dimensional doors in the [Spire](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md#spire). It is presumed these symbols are the language of the Gods, and that it declares a curse upon humanity for being stolen.

## Stats

### Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement by user, which Fraemia must accept as its user)

This spear is long and shines of gold. Along the main shaft and the tip there are ancient symbols dating back to over a thousand years ago.

Sentience. Fraemia is a sentient true neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Abyssal.

The abilities granted in each state stack, but the limitations do not. For example, you may cast Lightning Bolt in an Exalted state twice in one day, but then only a third time once at a lower level, similar to spell slots. To use the abilities, the user *must first* activate Fraemia, which requires a bonus action.

### Risks

Every time the user of Fraemia ignites the spear with lightning or uses one of its abilities, roll a 1d10 to determine a potential side effect the user will experience:

1. Roll two more times, rerolling on a 1. An 8-10 negates anything else.

1. Half of the damage inflicted by Fraemia on a current or upcoming attack will also be inflicted upon the user.

1. Roll a 1d4, and if the user gets a 1, they gain short-term madness. If the user already has short-term, they instead gain long-term madness, and if the user already has the latter, then they gain indefinite madness.

1. Any attack by an enemy has advantage against the user on their next turn.

1. Uncontrolled lightning erupts from the spear. Any creature within 10 ft. of the user, including the user takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. Add 1d6 for every state beyond Dormant.

1. The spear burns the user's hands. The user takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.

1. The next attack used by the user has disadvantage.

1. -10. Nothing negative occurs.

### Dormant

The spear grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- While holding the spear, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing lightning to erupt from the head. This energy sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the spear is emanates energy, it deals an extra 2d6 lightning damage to any target it hits. The lightning lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the spear.
- While holding the spear, you can freely cast the Lightning Bolt spell (3rd level) (3/day) as an action.

### Awakened

When the spear reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra lightning damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 4d6.
- You have resistance to lightning damage while holding this weapon.
- While holding the spear, you can freely cast the Chain Lightning (6th level) (2/day) and Lightning Bolt spell (6th level) (3/day) as an action.

### Exalted

When the spear reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

- The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +5, and the extra lightning damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 6d6. Lightning damage dealt by the spear ignores resistance to lightning damage.
- You are immune to lightning damage while holding this weapon.
- While holding the spear, you can freely cast the Chain Lightning (9th level) (1/day) and Lightning Bolt spell (9th level) (2/day) as an action.
- You may also teleport to any location a lightning bolt travels to by riding the lightning with the spear as a bonus action within the same turn the bolt was created.
- You may also cast Lightning Swarm (1/week): Blazing orbs of lightning plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10d6 lightning damage and 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one lightning burst is affected only once. The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

### Ascended

When the spear is ascended, it gains the following properties:

- The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +7, and the extra lightning damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 8d6. Lightning damage dealt by the spear ignores immunity to lightning damage.
- You are immune to lightning damage while holding this weapon.
- You may also teleport to any location a lightning bolt travels to by riding the lightning with the spear without expending a bonus action.
- You may also cast Lightning Swarm (1/long rest) instead with 20d6 damage rather than 10d6.
- All spells casted with Fraemia can recharge once per long rest instead of per day.
- Risk number 7 now has the effects of 8-10.
- When rolling risk 2, you may choose to perform double damage on your target with the cost of taking half of that damage yourself, ignoring resistances and immunities.

Proficiency with a spear allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
