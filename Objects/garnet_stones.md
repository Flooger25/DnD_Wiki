## Description

The stones range in size from dimes to the size of an adult human's palm. They glow in a green color and are slightly translucent.

## Powers

The primary function of the garnet stones on Venga Isle is to sustain life. These stones enable the growth of the forest, nourish the land, and maintain the island's ecosystem. The stones are connected to the natural world in a profound way, allowing all living things on the island to thrive. Every islander is given a piece of the stone to use during their lifetime, which helps them in various daily tasks and enhances their well-being.

The garnet stones amplify magical abilities. The islanders use the stones to create powerful potions, herbs, and other magical items. Their unique energy enhances the potency of spells and other mystical practices, making the stones a highly sought-after resource for those who understand their true value. The magical energy within the stones is harnessed to benefit the islanders and protect their way of life.

Outside of Venga Isle, the garnet stones are coveted as a potent source of energy. Colonizers from Brasshaven discovered that the stones could be used as a power source for weapons and machinery, leading to widespread mining operations. Their ability to generate magical energy makes them valuable to militaristic and industrial forces, who seek to exploit their powers for personal gain.

The stones are not only physical objects but also have a deep spiritual connection to the islanders. They are believed to hold ancient magic, passed down from the natural world itself. Their sacred role in the island's traditions involves returning the stones upon death, which symbolizes the islanders' cyclical relationship with nature.

Despite their life-giving properties, the garnet stones can be weaponized and have been used for destructive purposes. Powerful forces, including the Marshall and other antagonistic factions, seek to harness the stones to fuel dark magic and deadly devices. The stones' inherent energy can be twisted into dangerous forms, making them both a blessing and a curse depending on how they are used.

## Legacy

The Garnet Stones are a dual-edged forceâ€”offering life and power to those who respect their magic while also becoming a source of destruction and exploitation when used improperly. Their immense energy, both magical and spiritual, makes them one of the most significant objects in the [Commodian Isles](../Locations/Land/commodian_isles.md).
