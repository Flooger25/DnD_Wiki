# Brasshaven

Brasshaven is the major city-state of the [Commodian Isles](../Land/commodian_isles.md), positioned in the [South Eastern Sea](../Planes/pulchra.md#south-eastern-corner). First settled and founded sometime in the 2nd or 3rd to last century of the 4th Age, it has since grown and become an independent city-state in the isles, acting as a hub for trade and commerce in the Isles and the entire region.
