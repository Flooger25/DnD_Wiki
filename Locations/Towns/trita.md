# Trita

Trita is both the capital and largest city of the [Republic of Ismaia](../../Factions/Nations/republic_of_ismaia.md), and that of the entire region of the [Old World](../Land/old_world.md). It is positioned on the east coast of the Ismaian region and at the mouth of the Ismaian gateway/river.

Trita is a rich city of culture, commerce, art, magic, science, and equality. It is known as the crowning jewel of Pulchra as it has become a safe haven for all peoples of the world and provides opportunity to those who seek it. In addition, historians have calculated that it is the biggest known city in history and has the largest GDP per capita.

Besides being the capital of the Ismaian government, it is also the capital of the adventuring world and that of the League of Adventurers. Because of this it has become an incredibly valuable international city for those in the Old World, Meridia, and Caelus.

"Trita is where anybody can be rich, because, well in fact, everyone is."
-- Arcellus the Historian, circa 299 5A.

## History

### Native Migration

The first traces of intelligent life date back to the early 4th Age when dwarvish tribes migrated north from modern day [Mavellia](../../Factions/Nations/mavellian_dynasty.md). For the following millennia a variety of racial tribes rose, fell, and warred with one another.

### Early Settlements

Several early settlements were established and solidified in the final century of the 4th age, including the precursor to Trita, which at the time was known as Porticcident. The early settlement became a prime example of various races coming together to build a better future. Old tales and songs sing details of the idyllic and hedonistic lifestyle the peoples of Porticcident shared as they had an abundance of resources available to them. Unfortunately for them this would all soon end due to events happening thousands of miles away.

### Cataclysm Years

The effects of the [Great Cataclysm](../../Events/great_cataclysm.md) were widespread and destructive in modern day Trita. Due to global food shortages and chaos of governments collapsing, the settlements in Ismaia collapsed entirely. This led to many groups fleeing further west to avoid the generational climate changes. These groups initially warred and exterminated one another, but after years of conflict they banded together to found the city of Red Rock, which was the inspiration for its name.

Due to Ronin Mavell's success in uniting small kingdoms to the south east, the settlement of Porticcident pleaded with the newfound [Mavellian](../../Factions/Nations/mavellian_dynasty.md) dynasty to absorb them to stop the mass starvation and conflict.

Ronin's request was accepted and in return Porticcident was included within Mavellian jurisdiction. For being absorbed the city became the center for food redistribution in the Ismaian region, which brought thousands of settlement people's to migrate to the city. This was the first major growth the city experienced, and toward the end of the cataclysmic days the city and surrounding areas became self-sustaining.

The city became Ronin's self-described crowning achievement in his efforts and behind closed doors expressed it was his favorite city. Legends speak that on his dying bed he shared he used to have dreams about 3 shining stars illuminating the streets of Porticcident at night and this was the gods' way of guiding their followers in the holy lands of the region. Allegedly this led to him referring to the city as Trita, a decade before the War of the 4 Lords.

### War of the 4 Lords

Once the destruction and changes of climate from the cataclysm came to a conclusion, there was an initial rush by all lords to retake their lands and takeover the lands of their century long rivals. There was little conflict in the settlement of Trita during this time, however, as the nobles remembered the horrors of the cataclysm days, so they united together. This soon changed when one of the lords was found dead in an assassination several years after peace and after King Ronin's death.

Fingers were pointed and soon the 4 lords of the Porticcident settlement summoned their arms and a destructive war occurred in and around the city. This consumed the smaller villages within a hundred mile radius of the city and spread further.

After 3-5 years of conflict between the 4 warring lords, the 3 sisters of the modest and neutral house of Kasir came together and agreed to be married to the heirs of 3 houses. Each of the 3 sisters were extremely skilled in their respective fields, which made them borderline demigods. Naesala the druid, Viessa the wizard, and the oldest Sariandi the sorcerer.

The marriage offering angered the Tilda house, one of the 4, which in response attempted to assassinate the youngest of the sisters, Viessa. Fortunately the assassination attempt failed, and in response the 3 remaining houses concluded the war by uniting against Tilda and destroying them completely. The legends told tell rumors of the Tildan heir having escaped to Red Rock in the deep west.

### Council of the 3 Sisters and Founding of Trita

It was agreed by the founding 3 houses that a formal government should be established as the law of the land. The 3 sisters, being the bridge between the houses, came together as the Council of the 3 Sister and created a document of confederation they nicknamed the "Confederation of the 3." This became more publicly known as the Treaty of Trita, which inspired the sisters to name their settlement Trita. Thus the city was founded in year 36 of the 5th Age.

The three sisters governed the city for several decades. Naesala expressed she no longer wanted to govern but rather spend her time caring for the people and performing druidic research, as she was worried about a growing threat from the west. The three agreed to open the council up to the people, which increased the size by 12, representing the 12 districts of the city. Each house would name their speaker through democratic means, but this was not enforced which eventually let the council be populated by the lords of the houses.

### Death of Viessa

In the year 68 the sister Viessa died due to unknown circumstances. There was no sign of magic, poison, or a physical attack. Due to her role in protecting and leading Trita's people, the whole city took a month to mourn her death. During this time the sister Naesala returned to the city only for a night to say goodbye to Sariandi. She then left to the west and was never seen again.

### First Tribal War

Due to Ronin's beliefs to leave Trita as an autonomous sub-state of the empire, the city continued to grow further and became an economic powerhouse. As time went on the official Mavellian policy of Trita shifted as Trita and Ismaia began to be viewed as a potential threat to the crown.

In 106 5A they tried to sway the council to give the king control over the Ismaian region, as Trita was the lead establishment there. The council, including Sariandi, was not receptive to this. The king knew all out war would be too costly, so they began a secret campaign to unite the tribal natives in the west of Ismaia to take back their lands.

Various guerrilla attacks occurred on the outskirts of the colony, which became known as the first Tribal War.

In the year 120, the council was the council of 13 for 52 years. Sariandi was now over a hundred years old and was alive due to her magical abilities to maintain health. During a private trip to personally aid villagers on the edge of the Ismaian colony, she and her entourage were ambushed by a united force. Sariandi was able to fend off the ambush enough for the citizens to escape but was brutally killed in the process.

Word spread of the attack and Trita was immediately galvanized. The native force attacked the city but was thwarted despite an unorganized Tritan response between the lords. This led to the Ismaian colonies destroying any and all natives within the borders of the colony and on the edge. Sariandi and the sisters would have never wanted this, but the city's rage took over Ismaia completely.

A peace was established between the native alliance and Ismaians. They both agreed to not enter each other's lands and the natives also agreed to move further west as the Ismaians had the upper hand in the negotiations. The last natives left the neutral region by 135.

### Mavellian Colonization

To continue the effort in controlling Trita and the western colonies, Mavellia sent troops into the country to peacefully replace the existing guards and soldiers across the country. Loyalists were planted.

Over the following years small skirmishes occurred between Mavellian and Ismaian troops but tensions were kept back due to the council taking the position that they are a satellite for the king. The people of the city were initially told this was good for them but as the presence of Mavellian troops and their aggressions continued, the people became aware of the truth.

### Day of Red

Council member Vorin Jestunu was well loved by the people of Trita. He was a known follower of the anti-imperialist movement against the empire and in 188 was caught in a tussle against some of their troops. This led to a kangaroo trial where he was sentenced to death. For the following week the city was in an uproar as they concluded by popular opinion the sentence to be a farce. The lord commander of the Mavellian troops thought otherwise and had him scheduled to be executed on October 10th that year.

During the day of execution there were mass protests in the street. A clash occurred between Tritans and the wall of troops protecting the execution area. Several protesters broke through the defense and in response a fireball was casted on the crowd, burning dozens of civilians alive. This triggered the crowd into turning into a riot.

The city fell into chaos and the council was able to send in Tritan-backed peace keepers to protect the citizens, as the Mavellian troops had orders to kill anyone disloyal to the crown. For the next 8 hours the streets turned into a battlefield. By dawn of the next day the city was under complete Tritan control.

The day became known as the Day of Red, and the soon to be founding members of the Ismaian Republic sent messages out to their fellow Ismaian cities to unite against Mavellia to compensate them for the losses of their troops. In addition, the council sent a letter addressed to the king directly that they were to be independent and compensated for Tritan losses. The king did exactly what you would think.

### Ismaian Revolution

Trita was unequivocally the most vital city for both the revolutionaries and Mavellians. It was the center of the movement, that of the economy, and that of food and supplies. The council members of Trita summoned the leaders of the other cities and together they established a blockade around the coastal cities to stop export of vital goods to the empire's homeland.

The king would not have any of this so he sent what navy he could to quell the poorly fit Ismaian navy. Initially the king wanted to seek diplomatic options, knowing how important and costly it would be to wage a war against Ismaia as they've been growing stronger for the past several decades. It is unknown as to how it was done but allegedly as the Mavellian negotiator was on their way to meet with the revolutionary leaders, they attempted to suicide bomb the group. There is no way of knowing as an imbued fireball spell on an object would have destroyed the object.

This was seen as an attack and potentially justification for the Ismaians firing first, but it is also unknown who fired the first shots in the bay. Either way the shots were fired and the Battle for Ismaia began. If the Ismaians lost the naval encounter, the city could have been taken and the revolution would be thwarted. After several hours the Mavellians were victorious on the water as the Ismaians ordered a retreat to not completely lose their navy.

The Mavellians had a substantial upper hand, however, years of preparation for an attack from the western tribes, a rival colony, or a rival empire justified making Trita an impenetrable fortress. In fact, the city was inherently designed to be impossible to traverse on the inside due to the original War of the 4 Lords. Historians argue you can even see where those 4 fortresses were within the city despite the city growing above and around it for the last hundred years.

The Mavellian army and navy were unable to penetrate into the city, so they had to settle for a blockade. This wouldn't be the upper hand the empire thought as the city was mostly self sustaining, however, the council knew they had to reopen the roads outside of the city to keep the city alive, so that is where their towers of ranged attacks focused.

The empire began a massive land invasion to the south to capture one city/region at a time. This gave Trita enough breathing room to take back control of the land-based roads north and west. Fortifications began on the south while the enemy navy wait outside.

The king's forces marched further and further north, getting closer to Trita. The prospect of them being able to capture the city became more worrisome as the entire land army's primary focus was conquering Trita. This soon changed when the Ismaian Revolution evolved into a global conflict bringing in the Iptian Alliance, [Caelian Union](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_union.md), [Kingdom of Athal](../../Factions/Nations/kingdom_of_athal.md), and Northern Meridian kingdoms into the conflict in 191 and 192.

By 195 several years had passed which involved the Mavellians having to redirect much of their army and navy to Meridia, the South Eastern Sea, and surrounding areas of Mavellia. Because of this Trita was able to break out of its shell and push south, reclaiming lost territory. In addition the Ismaian fleet had several years to rebuild and repair their fleet enough to take on the prowling imperial fleet. Fortunately by the time they arrived at Trita to take the waters back, the Mavellian fleet had disappeared, likely off to fight thousands of miles to the east.

The war was practically over for Ismaia as the Mavellians would never be able to set another foot into Ismaian lands again. Leaders of Trita and Ismaia came together and agreed upon an armistice with the king, which he begrudgingly accepted, but more was to be discussed. What is the future of Ismaia without the empire? A new nation was about to be formed.

### Confederation Convention and Founding of the Republic

The following year, in 196, a Tritan-led convention was established to unite the Ismaian lords to negotiate an armistice with the king. During this they debated what to do with Ismaia's future. Months of discussion went on and by the fall of that year the rulers of each duchy in Ismaia agreed to form a new nation bounded by law and freedom for all those who have been or could be harmed by a central power.

The nation of the United Republic of Ismaia was formed with Trita representing its capital. It would be a two branch government comprised of a senate and judicial court. Trita would house all senate hearings and be the location of the national supreme court. Each sub-state of Ismaia would be represented by 3 senators; a lord, a designated intellectual/historian/scientist, and a chosen citizen. The first would be chosen by each sub state's own laws, whereas the other two would be elected by the people.

This model was inspired heavily by the council of 12 of Trita, especially that of the democratic wishes of the three sisters.
