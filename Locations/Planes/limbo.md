# Limbo

The ever expanding void of Limbo is an infinite plane of chaos and silence. It is known as the bottom, or even epicenter, of the multiverse, and where all things degrade into infinity.

Below is a crude map made of the region known as the [Flats of Limbo](#the-flats), sometime at the end of the 4th Age:

## Description

Limbo acted as the catcher, and what some would consider the garbage dump, of the universe's [planar shifts](#planar-shifts). It has its own inhabitants, who were birthed from the neutral chaos of the plane itself, but also those from other facets of the universe that were either lost or came from the shifts.

Limbo shares the role to that of the [Astral Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane) in Forgotten Realms.

### Planar Shifts

As the universe continues to expand, there are multi-dimensional "growing pains" experienced known as planar shifts. Shifts allow different moments in time and space to overlap, which causes errors in the flow of existence. Scholars have described the flow of existence similar to a snake's body, and the shifts being moments where the snake intersects with itself. When the shift is strong enough, the time, space, and matter in question is flung into the astral sea and soon falls through the fabric and into a location in Limbo, since there is nowhere else for the objects in question to go.

Due to the phenomena of planar shifts, Limbo has collected evidence of all facets of existence over the course of its long history, as if it is the museum of reality.

## Geography

It is commonly assumed that Limbo is an infinitely flat plane since no known entity has ever found any sort of edge. In addition, because of Limbo's role in that of the multiverse, despite how large the plane may be, one can always find various creatures, ruins, and locations of interest in the vast expanse of the realm. The surface of Limbo resembles that of a flat land with some natural formed terrain such as mountains, hills, oceans, and cliffs. It is not known, however, whether these locations arrived due to planar shifts or were there at the beginning of the plane's inception.

## Creatures

### [Yugoloths](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yugoloth)

Many of the inhabitants of Limbo were creatures known as Yugoloths. They primarily lived within or around the [flats of Limbo](#the-flats).

### Demons

Various demons were known to reside in this dimension. Some included Balors and others included more transcended demonic variants, such as Six's bane[](TODO).

### Lost Souls

Many souls and creatures who are unable to enter the plane of their alignment are considered to be lost in the universe and may find themselves in Limbo after their death. They are destined to walk and wander the plane, looking for a meaning to it all. If they are not careful, however, they risk all sorts of torment for those who rule over the lands of Limbo.

#### The Walker

One of the oldest lost souls, and perhaps one of the first of his race, fell into Limbo thousands of years ago. It is said he travels the flats of Limbo in one direction, hoping to find the edge of the plane to no longer be lost. Some say his soul has been consumed, optimists believe he still walks to this day, perhaps now billions of miles away from all others.

### Primordials

#### Dendar

[Dendar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dendar) is known to meander in the realm of Limbo.

## History

It is believed that Limbo has existed for as long as the multiverse, with some scholars even suggesting it could be primordial given how populated the realm is with evidence pre-dating early history.

## Locations of Interest

### The Flats

The great flats, or planes, of Limbo were a large region of dusty and rustic flatland. Many of the intersections between other worlds were more commonly noticeable here given how monotonous the landscape was. There were often random hints of other worlds in this flatland that vary in size from small objects to entire cities. Because of the arid atmosphere, and dusty landscape, it was often for objects that fell here to either decay away or become buried beneath the dust.

### Infernal Rise

A wall of pure hellfire that splits Limbo. It is said hellfire was created by the Lord of Hellfire, Mephistopheles, but whether he deserves the credit for the wall itself has yet to be discovered.

### Moving Dust

A moving cloud of dust, like a storm, walks the flats of Limbo. Anyone, or anything, caught in it is destined to suffer at the hands of high speed particles of dust and sand, until their existence is shaved away into nothingness.

### Ruined City

The ruins of a great city that came from one of the [shifts](#planar-shifts) between worlds. Acts as a safe haven for wandering souls, both dead and undead alike. The city also served as a base of operations for the [Arch-Witch](../../Characters/kisiri.md), and was the location in which [Rystrasz](../../Characters/rystrasz.md) was imprisoned for the last time.

### Spire

The Spire is an infinite tower that acts as a hub between time and space. It's appearance matches that of a square shaped staircase that seemingly goes up and down infinitely, and on each wall exists a wooden door with various symbols above it. Due to the patterns of symbols that exist, it is deduced that there are 3 or 6 total parallel towers existing at the same time that can be accessed via specific doors. All of the other doors in the tower access various locations in time and space of the multiverse, therefore the Spire served as a gateway to multiple realities for those daring to risk what might be on the other side.

### Fog Lands

A region that lay next to the flats, and off the coast of the [ruined city](#ruined-city). It is comprised entirely of fog with no vision beyond a hundred feet at most. No traveler has been able to fully chart the region nor understand what meanders amongst the clouds, but what is known is that similar to the flats, random remnants of other worlds can be found decaying here. In addition, one might hear the screams of lost souls and dark creatures that lay waiting for someone to meander to them.

### Aziliroth

A magnificent but monstrous fortress embedded in the mountains surrounding the flats of Limbo. No one knows who lives at or manages the fortress, but some rumors speak of a demon prince who keeps away the horrors beyond the flats.
