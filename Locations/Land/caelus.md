## History

## Independent States

### Natives

Before the arrival of Anduin and settling of the Dominion, various native communities comprised of Orcs or Dwarves existed on the continent. Some Elven cities also existed on the southern most tip of the continent, however when settlers arrived, both communities were able to integrate fairly easily. Integration was not so easy for the Dwarven and Oricish communities however, so many migrated to the Northern Fields, Ashein, and Kisiria.

The ancient dragon [Miirakail](../../Characters/miirakail.md) also inhabited Caelus, likely before any other life on the continent. All that is is known about where is that he likely lived among the mountains of Athal or Lindoline.

### Dominion of Anduin

The [Dominion](../../Factions/Nations/dominion_of_anduin.md) was founded in 0 PA, or 1256 of the [4th Age](../../Events/timeline.md#4th---age-of-the-ancients) and covered all of the area of Caelus, including Pelrock Isle. During its existence, many of the natives of Caelus were either segregated to the Northern Fields or Ashein, integrated, or migrated off of the continent.

### Caelian Empire

In 1326 PA, under the command of [Oric Valdes](../../Characters/oric_valdes.md), the Dominion was usurped and reorganized into the [Caelian Empire](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md). For 17 years the Empire ruled and invaded surrounding lands by land and sea, nearly conquering the entirety of the south eastern corner and far beyond until its collapse with the death of High Lord Oric Valdes. The invasions are known as the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md). The death toll and destruction was so great it paved the way for struggle for the next several generations. After the occurrence of the [Great Cataclysm](../../Events/great_cataclysm.md), the years required for full societal recovery hit centuries.

### Caelian Union

After the fall of the Caelian Empire, the eastern regions banded together to form the Caelian Union.

### Kingdom of Athal
