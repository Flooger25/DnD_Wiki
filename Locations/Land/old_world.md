# Old World

The "Old World" is a region on the [Pulchran](../Planes/pulchra.md) supercontinent [Praeia](../Planes/pulchra.md#praeia) in which it is believed the first civilized form of life had originated. Many of the races today can find their roots from somewhere in this region, therefore there is heavy religious influence to those who live there today. Some religions claim that when the gods walked the world, this is where they stood.

## History

### 3rd Age

The earliest recorded history in the Old World dates back to the first Dwarves of Moradin. It is said they came from the Protaran Summit and lived in the valleys toward the coast, but after years of strife, the dwarvish people split with some heading toward the Grancanan Hills and others east to what will eventually be Meridia.

#### Post-Cataclysm (0-24)

Due to the events of the Great Cataclysm, a great famine had occurred, affecting most, if not all, of the regions in the Old World. Over the first months and years, political stability began to wane, until eventually chaos had enveloped the populous cities. Some of the more powerful kings and lords were able to hold their own against mobs, but most perished as their government fell before them.

The following decades, new lords rose and united small lands, and the old perished. This time period was filled with constant warring and lack of stability.

One of the warring lords, and considered the most successful conquerer of the lands, Keletar Mavell, had created the first newly birthed nation after conquering all of Shiria. As this time frame of chaos had approached its end, Keletar had conquered many lands and had established order and unity between them. This unification would soon be known as the start of the Mavell Dynasty, for Keletar's growth in power had only begun.

During this time period, due to the outcome of the Meridian Wars and that of the cataclysm, the unified Western Meridia had fallen to pieces. Similar to the rest of the Old World, Western Meridia had now been divided into smaller territories governed by local Meridian lords. Western Meridia would not be united again, until the New Iptian Alliance.

#### First Western Migration (24-29)

A great migration occurred, leaving the core regions of the Old World behind and expanding the map itself. Regions such as Ismaia, Iptiyabur, Silandria, and even beyond Grancana saw a great increase in settlers.

#### Reconstruction & Colonization (29-153)

#### Mavell Conquests (153-186)

With tensions high in the South Western Corner of the world, all it took was a spark of aggression for total war to occur. This spark was the ascendence of Maldwyn Mavell as King of the Mavell dynasty. He believed it was Mavell's right to rule all that which is seen by the Gods, therefore he begun war with his neighbors.

For the next several years, the Mavell Dynasty had crushed, conquered, and absorbed surrounding kingdoms into its own. Even after the death of Maldwyn in combat, the empire had slowly grown for the next several generations, extending its influential reach. Despite not conquering the east as Maldwyn would have wanted, the Old World was still theirs to take.

#### Commodian Intervention (186-188)

The greed of the Mavellian Empire, and King Zun Mavell, continued when their eyes gazed upon the lush Commodian Isles off the coasts of the South Eastern Sea. Control of the Isles would provide substantial control over the seas, which would solidify the empire's grip on the regions.

Conquering the Isles outright would not only be costly but King Zun worried it could unintentionally galvanize the other nations which also had powerful navies, more specifically those of Northern Meridia and Caelus. Because of this and the Commodian government's inability to maintain order due to anti-government factions, including pirates, the two powers agreed to assist one another. The Mavellians sent an infamous admiral of theirs to represent the nation's interests, Admiral Adamo Sandiso.

The arrival of the first few Mavellian warships was not well received, and this created further tension, which culminated in attacks on both official Commodian and Mavellian vessels by the pirate lords of the Isles: Nendros, Bray Lindsay, Delvin Ross, Margaret Thatcher, and James Morgan.

The skirmishes with the pirates became increasingly costly for the Mavellian fleet and the Commodians were preoccupied with fighting a land war against a rebellion group known as the Legion of Man, so the Mavellians decided to crush the alliance's enemies in one swoop. Initially they decided to form a business relationship between Adamo and pirate lord Margaret Thatcher where the king's funds would be used to provide payment to the pirate lord in exchange for pirates' locations and movements. This proved to be highly successful and lucrative for Margaret, however a large number of pirates seemed to be sourced out of Helrock Isle, therefore the King's eyes turned to it.

Helrock and Unified Commodia had a long history of conflict and the most recent being when the latter conquered them in the year 174 of the 5th age after a long struggle beginning with Helrock declaring independence. Since then Helrock has been nothing but a nuisance for Commodia by supporting the subversive activities of the pirate lords against them. King Mavell made the controversial decision to crush and take over the island nation in one fell swoop.

On September 3rd of 188, a Mavellian armada surrounded Helrock Isle and landed thousands of troops. On a beach west of Helrock City the pirate lord Nendros led a defense with the aid of the adventuring party the [Bean Team](../../Characters/bean_team/bean_team.md). Despite losing 3 frigates in a massive explosion, the Mavellians were able to capture the island and weed out the dissenters. In addition, Admiral Adamo was able to capture the pirate lord Nendros, who was known to have substantial influence over the rest of the pirate lords. This was a major victory for the empire.

The outcome of Helrock spread through the isles in less than a day, and once pirate lord Lindsay was aware of the news and Nendros' status, he formally declared war against the Mavellian Empire and Unified Commodian government. He urged the other pirate lords to follow, but none initially did. In response, King Zun put out a massive bounty for Bray Lindsay.

Admiral Adamo was determined to show the strength and resolve of his force, so he scheduled a public execution for the captured high profile enemies of the state, including Nendros. Sometime around 1 in the morning on September 11th, the secretive super ship being constructed by Commodia and Mavellia was stolen, the Harbinger. This triggered Adamo to move up the execution date and rush it. Unfortunately for him the combined forces of the Bean Team and Legion of Man were enough to thwart him. Adamo was forced to retreat as the primary land defense force were the Commodians who surrendered in droves due to the Legion's surprise siege. At this moment the Unified Commodian government had fallen completely, so Adamo declared martial law and himself as Governor of Commodia on behalf of his majesty the king. Adamo sent a message to King Zun Mavell for more of the armada. The king's mistake was sending so much as at this point they were putting more than half of their navy into controlling Commodia.

Adamo's preemptive request for assistance proved to be wise in the short term as a new enemy entered the seas. A secretive faction of [Caelian Empire](../../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md) loyalists revealed themselves as the thieves of the Harbinger, and via dark magic they were able to make the first rate ship even more powerful. It was strong enough to destroy dozens of Mavellian frigates, completely disabling much of their navy. It was at this moment that Adamo knew the isles were for naught and soon the world would gaze upon the dynasty with opportunity. Despite the defeat of the loyalists at the hands of the Bean Team, nearly half of the king's navy was destroyed and this was made public to the known world. The king's dynasty would soon be on the defense, so they left the isles entirely.

#### Wars of Independence (188-211)

Years of tensions culminated in a massive riot in the streets of Trita, the largest city of the western colonies of Mavellia in the geographic region of Ismaia. Known as the Day of Red, on October 10th of 188 in Trita the riot turned extremely violent when one of the Mavellian keepers of peace had their wizard cast a fireball on the crowd. The keeper denies these allegations saying the message was misunderstood, but the damage was done regardless. This led to a revolt where the colonists took the city into their own hands.

News of the events spread throughout the western colonies and this created protests and disorder to such a degree that the empire could not control it. The largest cities on the coast banded together to create a defensive blockade of the colonies from the Mavellians. Independence was declared and any and all western colonies were invited to join in their movement. The western colonies were agnostic to the movement, intending to side with whichever would maintain security and control of the trade networks. The coastal colonies, however banded together and sent a message to the king simply saying, "The West is ours. If his majesty wishes to intervene, he brings death upon him."

In response to the events, the king sent half of his remaining navy to encounter the blockade. Talks occurred hoping to reduce tensions and slowly bring the colonies back into Mavellian control, but they were not receptive to these deceptive tactics. It is unknown who exactly fired first, but a skirmish occurred between an Ismaian and Mavellian warship that triggered a full scale naval battle on the coast of Trita. This became known as the Battle for Trita since if the revolutionaries had lost, it was commonly believed the king's forces could capture the city and the whole revolution would fall apart.

The Mavellians were victorius on the water due to the sheer numbers, however the city was extremely well fortified due to years of preparations by the Mavellians on a potential attack from one of her rivals. The city did not fall, so the Mavellian navy could do nothing but bombard and form their own blockade. The blockade went on for months and well into 189. During this time the revolutionaries were spreading word of these events to the rest of Mavellia's colonies.

During the blockade the empire began a land-based military campaign with the intention to cross the Bay River and move north along the coast. This proved to be a solid strategy as the revolutionaries did not have enough provisions and an organized military to defend the south and coast at the same time. In addition, the Mavellian's had control over the sea networks, which meant their land troops could resupply as they went up the coast.

During this time the Kingdom of Athal and the Caelian Union had formed an alliance and began moving into the Commodian Isles and to the eastern most coastline of Mavellia. Their unity raised alarms throughout the whole region of the world as it brought back horrible memories from the [Meridian Wars](../../Events/meridian_wars.md). Many nations in the region mobilized their navies and armies in preparation for a potental assault.

As if the region of the Old World didn't need enough tension, the sparks began to fly when an assassination attempt befell King Zun Mavell. Fortunately for the king it was not successful, but signs pointed to the assassin being a rogue from Yarrath. The king's campaign in Ismaia was increasingly successful and their frontlines approached the farms on the outskirts of Trita, so some troops were redirected to Yarrath to weed out those against the crown. This triggered a riot similar to that of the Day of Red.

Toward the end of 191 an alliance of Iptian lords was formed and summoned the aid of Northern Meridian kingdoms, which had the largest navy of the world at this time. With their aid the Iptian Alliance was able to remove all Mavellian loyalists in their union. This was the moment at which the Ismaian Revolutionary War turned into a global conflict. Many of Mavellia's colonies were dissenting, and two majors were in open revolution, so they summoned the aid of the Caelians to fight against the Iptian and Meridian alliance. Unfortunately for the king, the Caelians were a shell of their former self and they did not last more than 4 years in combat against the Iptians and Meridians.

The king had to redirect his navy and army against the additional fronts, and this was enough for Ismaia to not be taken over completely. The Ismaians gathered their forces and mobilized to push south back to the Bay River. By July of 195 the tide had turned and the king was unable to reconquer his former colonies.

In 196 an armistace was declared between the major powers. King Mavell continued to fight on against smaller nations without intervention as the Ismaians, Iptians, Meridians, and Caelians had spent enough resources in the conflict. During the next decade and a half for every kingdom taken by the king, another was lost.

The age of independence was formally recognized to be concluded when the Silandrians were able to diplomatically split from the Mavellian Empire, however commonly it was recognized to end 3 years later when the last kingdom surrendered to the king's rule.

By the end of the age the Mavellian Dynasty had shrunk its borders and power by 65% and the lands lost had split into over 5 major states. In addition, the original progeniture of the revolutions had formed their own democratic republic based on a constitution. Officially they were recognized as the United Republic of Ismaia.

#### New Iptian Alliance (211-244)

#### Ismaian-Silandrian War of 233

#### TODO (244-291)

#### First Age of Adventurers (263-291)

In 263, a no name adventure group was formed in a small village in Protar. Over its 28 year time frame, this group had grown a following, reputation, and immense strength fighting extremely powerful enemies and saving their people time and time again.

They became known as the Titans outside of their homeland, and eventually became deterrents of war between nations due to their power and respect attained. This would be the first time a world-influencing adventure party could maintain peace and would exist since [13](../../Characters/13/13.md), but it also wouldn't be the last.

It is commonly considered that the formation of the Titans was the start of the age of adventurers, however, after they were disbanded scholars chose to discern between the times before and after the Titans by calling them the First and Second age of adventurers respectively.

#### Second Age of Adventurers (291+)

The common understanding of the years after the dissolution of the Titans is considered to be the Second Age of Adventurers.

Before the Titan's disbandment many powerful nations wanted to mimic and have their own powerful individuals, despite the fact that the Titans did not formally or informally represent any colors. With the Titans gone these kinds of parties were introduced publicly to the world, and soon many other nations followed.
