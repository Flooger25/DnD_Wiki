# Old World

The "Old World" is a region on the [Pulchran](../Planes/pulchra.md) supercontinent [Praeia](../Planes/pulchra.md#praeia) in which it is believed the first civilized form of life had originated. Many of the races today can find their roots from somewhere in this region, therefore there is heavy religious influence to those who live there today. Some religions claim that when the gods walked the world, this is where they stood.

## History

### 3rd Age

The earliest recorded history in the Old World dates back to the first Dwarves of Moradin. It is said they came from the Protaran Summit and lived in the valleys toward the coast, but after years of strife, the dwarvish people split with some heading toward the Grancanan Hills and others east to what will eventually be Meridia.
