## Description

Starlight is a two-party campaign taking place in the Isamaian region of the [Old World](../Locations/Land/old_world.md). One party starts at level 5 and levels up rapidly to 20 by the end, and the other starts at 13, slowly leveling to 17.

The campaign explores the world in the Age of Adventurers! This time period is filled with adventurers with unique skills who originate from large cities to small hamlets from around the world. Forming a party and competing for wealth, glory, fame, and adventure is so common for folks of this time that there is even a League of Adventurers that watches over and maintains statuses between parties.

Given the level of power and reputation surrounding some of the most infamous parties, some have even been recruited to represent their home nation in conflicts. This acts as a way for nations to act out on their aggression without going to full scale war. For some nations, however, their imperialist tendencies mesh well with adventurers whose power categorizes them as weapons of mass destruction, for a single group of 5 individuals can sway the outcome of the largest battles.
