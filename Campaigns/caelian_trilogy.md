# Caelian Trilogy

The Caelian Trilogy is a trilogy of three fast-paced and short adventures whose events primarily take place on the [Pulchran](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md) continent of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md) and some locations in [Meridia](../Locations/Land/meridia.md). The campaign's original design was exclusive to the first arc, [Rise of Ebrihan](#rise-of-ebrihan), but soon grew into a 3 arc trilogy expanding on the events of the first arc.

## Plot

The main story of the Caelian Trilogy follows a party of adventurers through historical events on Caelus, and Meridia, during the finals years of the [4th Age](../Events/timeline.md#4th---age-of-the-ancients) of Pulchra. The story is broken up into three "mini" campaigns, each with their respective story, and together make up the trilogy as a whole adventure. The contents of the three main arcs are detailed in their respective sections [below](#rise-of-ebrihan).

The main story involves the political rise and fall of the [8th Duke of Ebrihan](../Characters/oric_valdes.md) and events associated in the Caelian region of [Ebrihan](../Locations/Land/caelus.md#ebrihan). By the end of the first arc, the Duke has claimed the [Dominion](../Factions/Nations/dominion_of_anduin.md) and reformed it into a dictatorial [empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md), for which he now rules as its High Lord. After a 17 year time skip, the players are reunited with the hope of adventuring and destroying the Empire, who by that point have nearly conquered all nearby territories. The group travel to the nearby region Meridia and discover the past on the High Lord. Once the truth is known of his power, the group steal the god weapon [Fraemia](../Objects/fraemia.md), infiltrate the High Lord's palace, and slay him to end the [Meridian Wars](../Events/meridian_wars.md). Little to their knowledge, the true threat of the region was secretly released as Oric fell, the [Arch Witch](../Characters/kisiri.md). The party's first encounter with the witch occurs during the trial of [Queen Eilis](../Characters/eilis_vidroth.md), who is wrongfully given all blame of the Empire's crimes, and subsequently the players are "killed" when the first encounter completes. They awake in a mysterious dimension known as [Limbo](../Locations/Planes/limbo.md), and they fight and adventure their way out to encounter the witch once again, while allowing their old adversary Oric to aid in slaying her. Before the final confrontation, the Arch Witch is discovered to be the lost daughter of [Anduin](../Characters/anduin_the_great.md), Kisiri, and her rise to power facilitates what is now known as the [Great Cataclysm](../Events/great_cataclysm.md). The party make their way to the final location, the ruins of Kisirith, and fight and destroy Kisiri, thus concluding the adventure.
