# Rise of Ebrihan

The Rise of Ebrihan was a revolt, and eventual revolution, against the king and government of the [Dominion](../Factions/Nations/dominion_of_anduin.md) on the continent of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md). The plot was orchestrated from the events of the [War of the Fields](war_of_the_fields.md) in an attempt to punish the crown for their cause of the war. The revolt led to the dissolution of the Dominion and reformation into the [Caelian Empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md).

Rise of Ebrihan also shares the name of the first arc of the Caelian Trilogy. Refer to it's [page](../Campaigns/caelian_trilogy.md#rise-of-ebrihan) for details.
