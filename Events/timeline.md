## Origin of it all

"The 9 gods once lived and ruled on the material world. Not satisfied with the rules legislated by the others, the God whose alignment was chaos and evil, created a new realm known as Inanis designed to be ruled by them and them only. For this crime, they were cast out by the others. This conflict took the life of both the chaotic evil and their counterpart, lawful good, for the universe had to stay in balance. Without its father, Inanis was transformed into the Void, now known as the Abyss. After these events, the 7 remaining fled the material realm to abandon the universe for an eternity. The darkest realm of existence lay waiting, for the heir to their father to rise." - The Keeper
