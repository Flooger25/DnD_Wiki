## Calendars

Below are different calendars used in the multiverse of the world of Pulchra, and information pertinent to said calendars.

### Post-Anduin

Post-Anduin refers to the time after [Anduin's arrival to Caelus](../Characters/anduin_the_great.md#arrival-to-caelus) during the 4th Age of Pulchra. It was primarily used by Caelians during the existence of the Dominion of Anduin, but was replaced at the turn of the 5th Age by the usage of [post-cataclysm](#post-cataclysm).

### Post-Cataclysm

The Post-Cataclysm calendar refers to the time after the end of the [Great Cataclysm](great_cataclysm.md). This time was primarily used by those directly affected by the cataclysm, and slowly died out as a primary calendar several centuries after the event.

### Year of Moradin

The Moradin calendar, or more commonly referred to as the Year of Moradin, represents the time after the dwarvan God [Moradin](../Factions/Religions/gods.md#the-dwarven-pantheon)'s creation of the dwarvish race. It is one of the oldest calendars, for it began sometime in the 3rd Age of Pulchra.
