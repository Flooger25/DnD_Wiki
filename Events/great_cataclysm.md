# Great Cataclysm

The Ancient Cataclysm, or formerly understood at the Great Cataclysm, was a catastrophic period of time in which famine, disease, and death engulfed the ancient world. It occurred due to the rise of the infamous [Arch Witch Kisiri](../Characters/kisiri.md) and her use of "the Titan", triggering volcanic events all over the south eastern corner, thus blanketing the world in ash and leading to decades of starvation. The effects of the initial cataclysm were so severe that nearly a quarter of the world's population had perished for the following 24 years. It is known as the greatest single tragedy in known [Pulchran](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md) history. In addition, the initial starting event of the cataclysm marked the end of the [4th Age of Pulchra](timeline.md#4th---age-of-the-ancients), and beginning of the 5th.
