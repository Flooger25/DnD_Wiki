# War of the Fields

The War of the Fields was a conflict that occurred on the continent of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md) between the primary state of the [Dominion of Anduin](../Factions/Nations/dominion_of_anduin.md) and the eastern regions of the continent [Ebrihan](../Locations/Land/caelus.md#ebrihan), [Kisiria](../Locations/Land/caelus.md#kisiria), and the [Northern Fields](../Locations/Land/caelus.md#northern-fields) between 1280 PA and 1291 PA. It began with the active king of the Dominion, [Aluuard Vidroth II](../Characters/aluuard_vidroth.md) forming imperialist and segregation policies against the eastern regions, and eventually invading them to assert dominance. The eastern regions fought and united quickly while declaring their desired independence. The conflict was terribly chaotic for other forces took advantage of it to set their own plans in motion. This was was also significant due to it being the first public appearance of the [Imperator](../Characters/oric_valdes.md#the-imperator), and first time in over a thousand years the god weapon [Fraemia](../Objects/fraemia.md) was seen and wielded. The war concluded with a Dominion victory, and the eastern regions were left in a state of destruction for the following generation. This outcome became the seed for the events of the [Rise of Ebrihan](rise_of_ebrihan.md), and eventual rise of the [Caelian Empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md), which became one of the most destructive states in history.

## Location

The War of the Fields took place entirely on the continent Caelus, and primarily on the eastern half.

## History

### Causes

As the 16th monarch of the Dominion of Anduin, [Aluuard Vidroth II](../Characters/aluuard_vidroth.md), grew older and more manic, he began to fear the culture and trust built by the communities of the east, specifically the Northern Fields, Kisiria, and Ebrihan.

To guarantee their obedience, Aluuard formed and enacted imperialist and segregation policies against the eastern regions, which included heavy taxation, requiring identification for travel, and theft of local succesful businesses.

In 1278 PA, one of the largest encampments of Orcs was attacked and burned down by the Dominion's elite soldiers. This sparked outrage in not only the Orc community in the Northern Fields, but also other non-human communities within and outside of the north. This made the eastern regions begin to trust and cooperate more than usual. This sparked further fear in the king, so to assert further pressure on obedience, he began militarizing the borders and key economic access points. In response, Ebrihan and Kisiria refused to pay the tariffs place on them, but were able to collect fees after taking advantage of the natives to the north.

Finally, in 1280 PA, the king had enough of the rebellious attitude the east had formed, despite the pressure he himself had forced on them, so in thinking that the people to the east would fear the Dominion and surrender quickly, he ordered the invasion of the lesser unified Kisiria and Northern Field regions, beginning the War of the Fields.

### Battle

#### Invasion

War begins with the Dominion's invasion of the Northern Fields and Kisiria. The natives of the north are unorganized and lack the technology to properly defend themselves, so they quickly lose their land until they're completely surrounded by the central river.

The Kisirians do not fair much better, for they are slowly pushed east, and within 2 years their final fortification of the city Kisirith is being sieged. The Kisirians are able to fortify the city as a stronghold, for now.

The state of Ebrihan was untouched by the Dominion's initial invasion, however within the first year they were ambused by the Dominion's forces, losing critical access to port cities and resources in central Caelus.

Within the first two years of the war, the eastern factions were unprepared and bleeding land to the Dominion every week, until it became clear to the leaders that a unification was necessary.

#### Eastern Alliance

The various unconquered, and surviving, native tribes, Kisirians, and Ebrihanians came together to form an Eastern Alliance to defend against the Dominion, and once the tide turned, to conquer them for their transgressions.

Starting in 1283 PA the new Alliance was able to conquer back swaths of territory, and even to the south invade parts of the Dominion's Athal region. The tide had turned, until what seemed out of nowhere, the Kisirian capital Kisirith was conquered and destroyed. This left a hole in the supply line that eventually shut down the pipeline of resources the Ebrihanians desperately needed.

#### Power of the Northern Fields

Ebrihan quickly lost most of its land, and its capital Italiath came under siege for the second time since the initial outbreak of war. Meanwhile, the natives were able to invade and conquer territories near the rivers in Ashein and Yagocryne. During this counterattack in 1284 PA, a new set of forces emerged for a short period of only a few dats in northern Kisiria. The combatants from all sides thought nothing of it, but what they didn't know was the war would soon take a dark turn into the abnormal, into the necromatic.

#### The Necromancer

The natives of the north were able to hold their own while the Dominion focused their forces primarily on Ebrihan. They were also stretched thin due to the invasions in the northwest by the natives. For about a year, the war entered a stalemate, with little to no movement on the frontlines or key forts.

In 1287 PA, mysterious reports similar those in 1284 PA suggested a dark magic permeating areas in Kisiria and the Northern Fields. Again, nothing of significance was thought of it beyond the Dominion potentially using dark magic in conflict, which can be managed with the right scholars. This theory was disproved, however, when undead soliders wearing banners of every faction began marching against the Dominion and Alliance.

As the Dominion lost men to the undead, they gained numbers. As the Alliance lost men to them, they continued to gain numbers. As the two factions killed each other, the undead increased even further. A new, and more existential, threat had risen.

#### Imperator of the Fields

The second siege of Italiath entered its 4th year in 1288 PA. A weakened point in the city's walls was exposed, so thousands of dominion soldiers began to flood into the city, wreaking havoc, and threatening the existence of Ebrihan and the Alliance.

During the siege, hordes of undead had wiped out many of Ebrihan's reinforcements meant to defend the city that day. It soon became clear that the undead were not entirely enemies of the Dominion for they had focused on Ebrihan's forces exponentially more than the former's.

It soon looked as if Italiath was to fall, until yellow lighting wiped out hundreds of soldiers, both Dominion and undead, within minutes. This became the first appearance of the [Man in Gold](../Characters/oric_valdes.md#the-imperator), later known as the "Imperator of the Fields." This unknown figure decimated both Dominion and undead alike, and single-handedly halted, and reversed the siege of the city, keeping Ebrihan and the alliance alive.

"I am near the city, hiding from the screams. Our men have infiltrated the fortress, but once the horrors began, I knew something wrong had occurred. All I could see was the yellow lightning piercing the walls and sky. The witch did not prepare us for this. The undead have met their match, and this war had become the hells we dare not think of."

-- Unknown Dominion Soldier, 1288, Siege of Italiath

#### Degradation of Ebrihan

By 1289 PA, the Imperator is able to lead victory after victory against the undead and Dominion.

In the same year, the Imperator is summoned by the Necromancer who asks for him to do a great task, and if that task is completed, the war will end. The task is to find and kill the ancient dragon of the name [Miirakail](../Characters/miirakail.md). The deal is made, and the Imperator and newly formed warrior group known as the Silver Guardians[](TODO) venture out.

While away from the battlefield, the Necromancer continues to take land from the Dominion, and even expand into the lands of the former alliance. Soon, the Guardians learn of the Necromancer's betrayal, and more from Miirakail once encountered, so they return to the war to combat against the Necromancer and destroy her for good.

In 1290, the Imperator is made commander of the Eastern Alliances forces. Soon, he  betrays the natives of the alliance to guarantee Ebrihan's preservation, thus creating a fourth faction in the war. This proves to be a good decision for Ebrihan now has exclusive access and control to the native's resources, but with the Imperator's focus on defeating the Necromancer and saving the continent, the Dominion see this as their opportunity to wipe what is left of the alliance and eastern regions once and for all.

The war comes to a quiet end as the Silver Guardians die at the hands of the Necromancer. The Imperator is able to defeat the Necromancer and the undead versions of his former party. He does this to save the continent, and his people, from the horrors of the undead. He knows the fate of his people is worse as undead compared to Dominion rule.

By the time the Necromancer falls, the last city of Ebrihan, Orham falls, thus ending the War of the Fields.

### Aftermath

With the defeat of the Natives and Ebrihanians, and complete destruction of Kisiria, the Dominion maintains full control of the continent. Colonial slavery is reinstated in the Northern Fields. Kisiria lays as a wasteland, and Kisirith is a quiet ruin and forever reminder of the horrors bestowed upon the Kisirians by the Dominion and undead.

The political implications for the Ebrihanian people is to be subservient to the Dominion. Harsh taxation, regional racism, and resource theft becomes common for the next generation. This treatment from the Dominion breeds resentment from the Ebrihanians, stirring and waiting for their chance to strike back at the Dominion and the aristocracy.

15 years after the war, in 1306 PA, an underground political movement of Ebrihanian businessmen and nobility is formed as the [Ravens](../Factions/Organizations/ravens.md). They plot Ebrihan's return as a political, cultural, and economic powerhouse on Caelus and in the [South Eastern Corner](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md#south-eastern-corner). There actions make it clear that they are willing to do anything and everything to enact their revenge. Only 6 years after its formation, the new [Duke of Ebrihan, Oric Valdes](../Characters/oric_valdes.md#duke-of-ebrihan) is instated. He is later revealed to have been secretly in command of the Ravens under his former alias, the Imperator.

### Caelian Empire

Some say the true end of the War of the Fields was the fall of the Dominion, and the rise of the [Caelian Empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md) in 1326 PA when Duke Oric, and the Ravens, lead a coup against the same King that invaded their homeland. During the coup, leaders, nobility, aristocrats, and supporters of the Dominion, especially during the war, were hunted down and executed for their hand in crushing Ebrihan. The coup resulted in disbanding the Dominion of Anduin for a new Caelian Empire, which would later go on to kick-off the [Meridian Wars](meridian_wars.md).
