# Meridian Wars

The Meridian Wars was a collection of invasions of [Meridian](../Locations/Land/meridia.md) regions by the infamous [Caelian Empire](../Factions/Nations/caelian_empire.md). It was a catastrophic conflict that affected the entirety of the ancient world at the end of the [4th Age](timeline.md#4th---age-of-the-ancients) of [Pulchra](../Locations/Planes/pulchra.md).

Below is a visual of the Empire's growth in borders during the war.

### Causes

With the reformation and birth of the Caelian Empire in 1326 PA, a new wave of nationalistic support came to the island continent of [Caelus](../Locations/Land/caelus.md). Their leader, High Lord Oric Valdes, was bent on the restoration and reparation of the Ebrihanian people, so a 3 year purge of non-loyalists and undesirables had occurred. The Empire's high command baked into their people the ideology that they were destined to rule all that Pulchra offers, for the [Gods of the White](../Factions/Religions/gods.md#faith-of-the-white) had decreed it so. With a unifying message, the Caelian Empire had been able to fully recover from the [War of the Fields](war_of_the_fields.md), and reorganize their economy to be more industrialized than ever. By 1332 PA, their political and physical strength had been so great they were ready to be unleashed upon the world.

### War

#### Invasion of the East

The war begun in 1332 PA with the invasion of the nearby island nations by the Caelian Empire. This included locations such as Pegren, the [Commodian Isles](../Locations/Land/commodian_isles.md#eastern-invasion), and the Eastern Isles.

With the political division amongst the regions of Meridia during the end of the 4th Age, no nations had come to the aid of these smaller governments, and because of this the islands fell very quickly. In response, Northern Meridia had banded together and begun armament for their own defense, incase the Empire had targeted them, but it was already too late.

#### Invasion of Meridia

In 1333 PA, with the fall of the island nations, the Caelian Empire had begun their official invasion of Meridia by attacking the northern coast of Northern Meridia. The Empire was able to get a foothold of the Ghili Peninsula in the same year, and acted as the primary launching point for their ground troops. Within two years, the coast of Northern Meridia was overrun, and soon after the states of the region had surrendered.

In the final months of Northern Meridia's stand in 1335 PA, the Caelian navy had pivoted their strength to the east of the coastline, targeting Eastern Meridia. They were able to destroy several of their trade and military ships, but the eastern region had already begun mass naval production, so their losses were quickly recuperated.

In 1336 PA, the Empire had been able to push deep into Eastern Meridia's territory while conquering the important region of Bolduhr, thus cutting off the rest of Central Meridia. The Empire was halted in the Eastern campaign for nearly two years, however, until they were able to nearly wipeout the East's navy completely in 1337 PA. This led to the eventual fall of Eastern Meridia in the following year.

With the continuous invasions of their neighbors, Western Meridia began mass mobilization in 1336 PA in preparation for a full scale invasion once the rest of Meridia had fallen. This expectation came true when in 1337 PA the Caelian Empire began a ground invasion from Bolduhr. With the fall of the East in the following year, the Empire was able to refocus their thin-spread naval strength to the west.

A slow and very arduous campaign for the Empire had begun, for tens of thousands of ground troops had died while the borders shifted back and forth. It seemed the Empire had finally met their match, for their campaign's success was largely attributed to the division and lack of an alliance from the Meridians. Thankfully for the Caelians, they had been mass producing their warships to eventually starve out the west. With the land units practically stuck, a massive naval war had occurred between the Empire and Western Meridia, for thousands of ships were cast into combat.

The war continued to be somewhat of a stalemate until 1343 PA when the Caelians had successfully been able to encircle and wipe out a substantial number of warships while taking a key city on the coast.

#### Beginning of the End

Despite the fact that a Caelian victory was near, the Empire was running out of supplies, slave labor, and wealth to fund the war any further. The event that had completely shifted the war, however, was the assassination of [High Lord Oric Valdes](../Characters/oric_valdes.md) at the hand of [13](../Characters/13/13.md) during the siege of the White Palace [](TODO). For the following weeks, what was left of the Caelian High command continued to have their forces invade deeper into the [Old World](../Locations/Land/old_world.md) while rumors of the High Lord's death mounted. The rumors were soon confirmed, and chaos and resistance to the Empire's rule had erupted across the regions, for the fall of the Empire had begun.

### Aftermath

During the months following Oric Valdes' death, what was left of the Empire had continued to fight against the Meridians and other resistance, until they were undoubtedly wiped out or imprisoned. What was left of the Empire's high command had fled to various locations on the fringes of civilization, including that of the Commodian Isles.

Meanwhile, those captured who worked with or for the Empire were tried and subsequently executed for their crimes against life. Little did the Meridians know, some Caelian bureaucrats inserted themselves within various governments to survive.

## Statistics

Over the 12 year war, the Caelian Empire had occupied the territories in which they captured. These territories underwent brutal and unprecedented treatment of locals and non-humans by the Empire, thus causing millions of people to perish due to famine and genocide. The upper bound of deaths caused is estimated to be 8 million, which accounts for over 5% of the world population at the time.
