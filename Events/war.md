# War & Strategy

evolution of Tactics and war technology

War is an intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.

While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances.

## How to Raise an Army

### Conscription

The factors that effect how many citizens can be conscripted for an army are as follows:

#### Common Factors

| Factor | Effect | Resulting Army |
| - | - | - |
| Base Population | | 4,000,000 |
| 10% of women bear arms | -47.7% | |
| Too young (<15) | -20.8% | |
| Too old (>45) | -6.3% | |
| Not physically capable | -10.4% | |
| Exempt skills/professions | -1.4% | |
| Outlaws, criminals, dodgers | -1.3% | |
| At muster (call-up) | -25% | |
| Ready by campaign start (2 weeks) | -25% | 242,500 |
| Other requirements (navy, town watch, border guards, customs agents, bodyguards, garrisons, camp guards) and lack of transport | -80% | 48,500 |

Another example, a kingdom with `1,000,000` citizens should be able to muster up an army with `12,125` soldiers within 2 weeks, and an army with the strength of `24,250` soldiers within 10 weeks.

#### Occupational Factors

| Factor | Effect |
| - | - |
| Non-Core Population | -95% (± 2%) |

For example, if a nation conquered another kingdom with `4,000,000` citizens with a nominal occupation policy, they would be able to recruit up `2,425` more soldiers within 2 weeks and a total of `4,850` soldiers within 10 weeks. This number may fluctuate depending on how gentle or harsh the occupation policies are.

### Military Costs

The following are costs associated with up-keeping a military force with the size of `1,000` soldiers.

#### Total Upfront Costs

| Item | Cost |
| - | - |
| Equipment | 3846 gp |
| | |
| | Total = 3846 gp |

#### Total Recurring Costs

| Item | Cost |
| - | - |
| Food | 104 gp |
| Pay | 2560 gp|
| Camp | 288 gp |
| | |
| | Total = 2952 gp |

For example, if a kingdom had an active army of `10,000` soldiers for one whole year, with 0 losses, it could cost a net total of `10,813,260 gp`.

## War Statistics

| Name | Dates | Length | Losses |
